# 17. Lambda handlers from a service model

![The model tree: twelve services, each with what it listens on, calls, and picks up from S3](expected/diagram-doc.svg)

## Scenario

A backend of twelve services on one message wire, each deployed as its
own Lambda handler. Every handler is the same forty lines with three
things that vary per service: the patterns it listens on, the patterns
it calls out to, and whether it picks up files from S3. The handlers
are generated, and the generator is **the handler file itself**: one
rule set whose body is the file, line for line, with three nested
dispatches where the file varies. It is here twice, in the two forms
of one generator: `gen.aon`, the canonical aontu, and `handler.ts`, the
same thing written as a Lambda handler with its aontu on marked lines. Both render the same thirteen files.

Nothing in the mechanism is about handlers. `emit`, `match`, `replace`,
`body`, `esc` and `form` are the whole vocabulary; what makes this
produce Lambda handlers is the target text in the body.

## The model tree

`model.aon` is one map of services; each has its `listen` and `client`
pins and its `on.file.events`, empty where it has nothing to say,
because the generator reads all three and a dispatch over an empty
selection emits nothing.

```
$
└── services
    ├── admin (3)
    ├── audit (3)
    ├── billing (3)
    ├── chat (3)
    ├── embed (3)
    ├── export (3)

    ├── ingest (3)
    ├── notify (3)
    ├── parse (3)
    ├── search (3)
    └── summary (3)
```

`aontu view doc --depth 2 model.aon` draws it, and `check.sh` pins it
with `--out --check`.

## The generator

`gen.aon` includes the model, gives each service its name
(`svc: $.services & pack($.services, { name:key() })`), and declares
the rule set:

```aon
%handler = emit(_, {
  match: name: string
  esc: sq
  replace: SERVICE: .name
  body: [
    "import { getSeneca } from '../../env/lambda/lambda'"
    ""
    "function complete(seneca: any) {"
    emit(.listen, {
      match: pin: string
      esc: sq
      replace: PIN: .pin
      body: ["  seneca.listen({type:'sqs',pin:'PIN'})"]
    })
    # ... the client pins, and the S3 hook over filter(.on.file.events, { source: s3 })
    "}"
    ""
    "exports.handler = async ("
    "  event:any,"
    "  context:any"
    ") => {"
    "  "
    "  let seneca = await getSeneca('SERVICE', complete)"
    # ...
  ]
})
```

Four things to read off it:

- **A value reaches a line through `replace`, not a hole.** `SERVICE`
  and `PIN` are ordinary TypeScript in the body; the map says which
  exact strings stand for a value, and the value is evaluated against
  the matched node. There is no delimiter to collide with the target's
  own syntax, which is why a deployment template's `${self:…}` or a
  backtick string survives.
- **Escaping is on.** `esc: sq` names the single-quoted convention
  every value is escaped by. The chat service listens on
  `sys:chat,user:o'brien`, and the handler carries
  `pin:'sys:chat,user:o\'brien'`, the line the compiler would
  otherwise reject.
- **A line is verbatim.** The two lines that are two spaces and
  nothing else, and the two blank lines, are in every handler because
  they are in the body. There are no trim markers, because nothing
  leaks: a rule is not an output line.
- **The conditional is the selection.** A service with no S3 events
  gets no gateway hook, because `filter(.on.file.events, { source:
  s3 })` selects nothing and a dispatch over nothing emits nothing.

The unit list is one dispatch over two parts, the service map and an
index marker: each service becomes a unit at `handlers/<name>.ts`, and
`index.ts` names every service in the model's order with a constant
spelled by the name-derivation chain, `join(form(split(_, "-"),
upper(_)), "_")`, so `index-build` is `INDEX_BUILD`. `form` keeps the
order where a `pack` would sort, and `aontu render --check expected`
holds all thirteen files.

## The same generator, in the target's own syntax

`handler.ts` is `gen.aon` again, as a template: **a marked line is
aontu source, and every other line is a line of output**. The marker
is TypeScript's comment token plus a dash, so the file is a Lambda
handler—`tsc` parses it, an editor highlights it, and the body lines are
the handler's own text at the indentation they land on.

```typescript
//- %handler = emit(_, {
//- match: { name:string }
//- esc: sq
//- replace: { SERVICE: .name }
//- body: [
import { getSeneca } from '../../env/lambda/lambda'

function complete(seneca: any) {
  //- emit(.listen, { match:{ pin:string }, esc:sq, replace:{ PIN: .pin }, body: [
  seneca.listen({type:'sqs',pin:'PIN'})
  //- ]})
```

`aontu render --check expected handler.ts` is green against the same
goldens: the entry's extension decides that it is a template, and it
is desugared before it is evaluated. `aontu template handler.ts`
prints the canonical form, which is `gen.aon`'s body with each output
line quoted, and `aontu template --check handler.ts` holds the file to
the spelling the round trip answers. Its **whitespace is output**, so
`render --check` against `expected/` is what holds the bytes.

## What check.sh proves

1. `aontu render --check expected gen.aon` is green: twelve handlers
   under `expected/handlers/` and `expected/index.ts` match their
   goldens byte for byte.
2. All thirteen files parse as TypeScript, by the compiler's own
   parser with no diagnostics.
3. `expected/handlers/chat.ts` carries `pin:'sys:chat,user:o\'brien'`:
   `esc: sq` escaped the apostrophe for the literal it lands in.
4. `expected/handlers/notify.ts` has exactly two lines of two spaces
   and two blank lines: whitespace is verbatim.
5. `ingest.ts` has the S3 gateway hook for `sys:ingest,cmd:file`,
   `notify.ts` has none, and `index-build.ts` hooks its S3 event and
   not its SQS event.
6. `expected/index.ts` is twelve lines in the model's order, starting
   with `admin`, and carries `export const INDEX_BUILD = 'index-build'`.
7. `bad/overlap.aon` (the key `P` inside `PIN`) is refused with
   `[aontu/replace_overlap]`, and `bad/unused.aon` (a key the body
   does not hold) with `[aontu/replace_unused]`, both before any node
   is visited.
8. `--check` against a copy of the goldens with one handler edited by
   hand is red, exit 1, naming `handlers/chat.ts`.
9. `render --format json` carries a trace entry for every emitted
   piece: each names a rendered unit and a rule, the `%handler` set is
   addressed by the name it was read through, and the twelve services
   are each matched at their own path in the model. `render
   --coverage` names no dead path and no declaration without a rule:
   one model, wholly consumed, one output, wholly produced.
10. `handler.ts`, the template form, renders the same thirteen units
   against the same goldens, round-trips as a fixpoint under `template
   --check`, and parses as TypeScript: the generator is a file in the
   language it generates.
11. The Go port renders the same thirteen units byte for byte and
   refuses the same seeded template (skipped with a note when no Go
   toolchain is present).
12. The Go port records the same trace, entry for entry.
13. The Go port desugars the template form and renders it identically.
14. The model tree draws and is pinned, text and SVG.

## Running it

From this directory, `./check.sh` runs all 14 assertions and exits 0.
It drives the TypeScript CLI (`ts/bin/aontu.js`, or the command in
`$AONTU`) and, when `go` is on the path, the Go CLI built from `go/`.
The verb by hand:

```sh
aontu render --stdout --unit handlers/chat.ts gen.aon   # one handler
aontu render --check expected gen.aon                    # hold them all
aontu template handler.ts                                # the template's meaning
aontu render --check expected handler.ts                 # and it renders the same
```
