# check.sh --- twelve Lambda handlers and their index, rendered from one
# model by one rule set written in the canonical form the template
# surface desugars to (docs/design/TEMPLATE.0.md D7). What this proves:
# a value reaches a handler through `replace`, with no hole syntax;
# `esc: sq` makes it safe in the single-quoted literal it lands in; a
# line is verbatim, so two lines of two spaces survive; a dispatch over
# an empty selection is the whole conditional; `form` keeps the model's
# order and closes the name-derivation chain; and both ports render the
# same bytes.
#
# Runnable from any cwd. `go` is optional -- the parity check skips
# with a note without it.
