# 11. Shared truth across repos: distributing a schema module

**Scenario.** A platform team owns the service deployment contract for
`corp.example`. Application teams (here, the checkout team) validate
their service definitions against that contract *from another
repository*, and an agent working in the checkout repo can trust that
the contract it sees is the contract the platform team approved. The
case covers module identity (`corp.example/schemas/service@1`),
vendoring by hand into `aontu_meta/vendor/`, the `mod tidy` / `mod verify` /
`mod vendor` / `mod manifest` verbs, canon-hash integrity pins, and the
publish-time breaking gate.

Everything below was produced by the real CLI; `check.sh` re-runs all
of it (33 assertions) and exits 0. All output shown is verbatim with
ANSI codes stripped.

## Layout

```
platform/service/               the module as published (v1.4.2)
platform/service-next-compat/   v1.4.3 candidate (compatible widening)
platform/service-next-breaking/ v1.5.0 candidate (required key added)
platform/service-v2/            v2.0.0 (same breaking change, major bump)
consumer/                       the checkout repo: mod.aon, main.aon, gate.aon,
                                plus the committed aontu_meta/mod-lock.aon and aontu_meta/vendor/
                                tree exactly as `aontu mod tidy` + `mod vendor`
                                left them
data/                           agent-emitted service candidates (JSON)
probes/refactor/                byte-different, meaning-identical module refactor
probes/transitive/              a module that depends on another module
probes/nested-ref/              a module with an internal $.-reference
expected/                       goldens (consumer output, tidy report, manifest)
```

Language features carrying the model: `close()` so consumers cannot
invent fields the platform does not operate; constraint atoms
(`re`, `min`, `max`) for field vocabularies; `*pref` defaults so a
two-line service definition renders a full deployment record; `k?:`
for the compatible-evolution probe; `hide()` to keep the imported
schema out of rendered output; module imports
`@"corp.example/schemas/service@1"` and the inline
`#aon1-…` pinned form.

The module is written self-contained, with no `$.`-references between
its own top-level keys: `$` is the root of the importing document, so
a module imported at a nested consumer key cannot reach its own keys
that way (`probes/nested-ref/` shows the refusal).

## The model tree

`consumer/main.aon` is a consumer repository's entry: it imports the
platform team's module and writes its own services against it. `lib` is
what the module brought (the deployment spec, with its defaults and
bounds) and `srv` is what this repository owns.

`aontu view doc --depth 3 consumer/main.aon` draws it, and `check.sh` pins it
with `--out --check`. A key with `(n)` after it is a container the
depth bound stopped at, and `n` is how many keys are not drawn; a
leaf carries its canon, which is the kind of thing it is rather
than its value.

## The distribution flow

**1. Cold start.** The consumer declares
`dep: { "corp.example/schemas/service@1": { v: "1.4.2" } }` and has
received nothing. `aontu mod tidy consumer/` exits 1:

```
verdict: missing
corp.example/schemas/service@1: not fetched (run: aontu mod get)
```

and writes no lockfile rather than a partial one.

**2. Distribution is a copy.** This build ships no registry client
(`mod get` and `mod publish` refuse with exit 2), so the platform tree
is copied by hand into the store layout the resolver expects:
`consumer/aontu_meta/vendor/corp.example/schemas/service@1/`: path segments
as directories, `@<major>` suffixed to the last one. The layout is
documented in
[`how-to/vendor-by-hand.md`](../../docs/how-to/vendor-by-hand.md) and
[`reference-api.md`](../../docs/reference-api.md#aontu-mod).

**3. `aontu mod tidy` then succeeds.** Exit 0, and `aontu_meta/mod-lock.aon` is
written as one canonical, diffable, JSON-parseable line:

```aon
# mod-lock.aon (generated by `aontu mod tidy`; do not edit)
lock: "corp.example/schemas/service@1": {
  canon: "aon1-zFHnyVa1fA--g8hTx8lUUhaKzzRUNI--2nDheIMsSFs"
  oci: ""
  v: "1.4.2"
}
```

The `canon` pin equals `aontu hash platform/service/service.aon` to
the byte. `oci` is empty: the module was copied in rather than
fetched, so there is no registry digest to record. `aontu mod vendor`
exits 0 and leaves the already-vendored tree alone.

**4. Evaluation resolves from `aontu_meta/vendor/`**, defaults fill, the
hidden schema stays out of the output, and two consecutive runs (JSON
and `--canon`) are byte-identical.

## What check.sh proves

1. Cold start, verify: on a consumer that has declared the dependency
   and received nothing, `aontu mod verify` exits 1 and names the
   repair, which is a tidy rather than a fetch:

   ```
   verdict: unlocked
   corp.example/schemas/service@1: not in the lockfile (run: aontu mod tidy)
   ```

   A project with no lockfile is not a verified one.
2. Cold start, tidy: `aontu mod tidy` on the same consumer is
   `verdict: missing`, exit 1, names the module and the fix
   (`not fetched (run: aontu mod get)`), and writes no lockfile.
3. After the platform tree is copied into `aontu_meta/vendor/`, `mod tidy` is
   `verdict: ok` and the lockfile it writes is byte-identical to the
   committed `consumer/aontu_meta/mod-lock.aon`.
4. `mod tidy --format json` matches `expected/tidy.json` (canon pin,
   `v`, empty `oci`), the CLI version line aside.
5. `mod vendor` leaves the already-vendored module in place,
   `verdict: ok`.
6. `aontu main.aon` matches `expected/consumer.json`: the consumer
   evaluates through `aontu_meta/vendor/`, `gift-cards` renders with the
   module's defaults (port 8080, replicas 2, tier `internal`, the
   healthcheck and telemetry blocks), and the hidden schema does not
   render.
7. Hermetic: two runs of the same inputs are byte-identical, as JSON
   and as `--canon`.
8. `aontu hash platform/service/service.aon` equals the lockfile's
   canon pin.
9. `hash --form` shows the hashed text includes the `close({…})`
   wrapper: closedness, invisible in plain canon, is inside the pin.
10. Tamper: flipping the vendored default `*8080` to `*9090` fails
    evaluation (exit 1) with both hashes named:

    ```
    module integrity: corp.example/schemas/service@1 expected aon1-zFHnyVa1fA--g8hTx8lUUhaKzzRUNI--2nDheIMsSFs got aon1-NHmNT6r-Lhy8di9BgGNRfgwNFT3r5PgCZxCYnJ4F0Ws
    ```
11. `mod verify` against the tampered store recomputes every pin,
    compares it with the committed lock, writes nothing, and refuses;
    `aontu_meta/mod-lock.aon` is byte-identical afterwards:

    ```
    $ aontu mod verify
    verdict: mismatch
    corp.example/schemas/service@1: pinned aon1-zFHnyVa1fA--g8hTx8lUUhaKzzRUNI--2nDheIMsSFs but the store means aon1-NHmNT6r-Lhy8di9BgGNRfgwNFT3r5PgCZxCYnJ4F0Ws
    $ echo $?
    1
    ```

    This is the check a CI job runs before it evaluates.
12. `mod tidy` run after the same tamper reports `verdict: ok` and
    re-pins the lockfile to the tampered hash. `tidy` trusts the store,
    and rewriting the lockfile is its job, which is why CI runs
    `verify` and the committed lockfile's diffs are read like code:

    ```
    verdict: ok
    corp.example/schemas/service@1 1.4.2 aon1-NHmNT6r-Lhy8di9BgGNRfgwNFT3r5PgCZxCYnJ4F0Ws
    ```
13. Refactor: replacing the vendored `service.aon` with the two files
    in `probes/refactor/` (an entry delegating to a reordered,
    re-commented `schema.aon`) gives new bytes and a new file count,
    and after re-tidy the pin is back to `aon1-zFHnyVa1…` with the
    rendered output unchanged. The pin hashes the module's meaning, so
    a refactor that preserves meaning preserves the pin.
14. Inline pin: a single file with
    `@"corp.example/schemas/service@1#aon1-zFHn…"`, no `mod.aon` and
    no lockfile, resolves and verifies: `get '$.svc.spec.port'`
    answers `8080`.
15. A mangled inline pin is refused with the same `module integrity:`
    error, exit 1.
16. User cache: with the module present only in the user cache under
    its canon-hash key, and a lockfile but no vendor tree, default
    trust evaluates to the same output as the vendored run.
17. `--trust root:<projectdir>` on that project fails with
    `module not fetched: corp.example/schemas/service@1`: the cache is
    outside the confinement boundary.
18. `mod vendor` copies cache → `aontu_meta/vendor/`, and the confined
    evaluation then passes with the same output.
19. The cache is keyed by canon-hash and consulted only once a pin is
    known: with the cache seeded but no lockfile, `mod tidy` is still
    `verdict: missing`. Vendoring by hand is the cold-start path.
20. `mod manifest platform/service` matches `expected/manifest-142.txt`:
    a deterministic OCI artifact description (config media type,
    canon-hash and major annotations, sorted layer file list).
    `aontu_meta/vendor/` is not part of the publish layer.
21. Publish gate, compatible: `mod manifest --against platform/service
    platform/service-next-compat` (1.4.3: replicas ceiling widened,
    optional `runbook?:` added) is `verdict: ok`.
22. Publish gate, breaking: `platform/service-next-breaking` (a
    "minor" 1.5.0 that adds a required `oncall` field) exits 1 and
    names the key it refuses on:

    ```
    verdict: breaking
    ...
    $.spec.oncall: the general value requires this key; the specific value admits instances without it
    ```
23. The identical breaking schema as `2.0.0` (`platform/service-v2`)
    is `verdict: ok`: the major lives in the module path, and no `@1`
    consumer can see it.
24. `mod get` and `mod publish` refuse with exit 2: this build ships no
    registry client.
25. Vet through the vendored module:
    `vet --at spec gate.aon data/checkout-good.json` is
    `verdict: valid`.
26. `data/rogue-sidecar.json` is `verdict: invalid`, with located
    `[aontu/constraint]` findings for the bad name and the
    non-corporate owner and an `[aontu/closed]` finding for the
    invented `sidecar` key.
27. Minimum version selection (`probes/transitive/`): the consumer asks
    `common@1` at 1.0.0, `service-dep` asks 1.2.0, and `tidy` selects
    1.2.0, the highest of the declared minima. Versions are exact
    minima and majors live in the path, so an upgrade is an edit to
    `mod.aon`.
28. The flat tree `mod vendor` writes is the layout a nested import
    reads: resolution tries every enclosing `mod.aon` root, nearest
    first, so `common@1` vendored beside `service@1` is found and the
    consumer evaluates.
29. The pin `tidy` locks for the dep-bearing module equals what
    `aontu hash` computes for the same file.
30. A second vendor tree nested inside the dependency
    (`…/service@1/aontu_meta/vendor/…/common@1/`) is a no-op: same closure,
    same pin, same output.
31. A module that does not evaluate on its own is not pinned. With
    `service@1` vendored but `common@1` absent, `tidy` refuses and
    writes no lockfile:

    ```
    $ aontu mod tidy
    verdict: error
    corp.example/schemas/service@1: does not evaluate on its own; nothing to pin
    corp.example/schemas/common@1: not fetched (run: aontu mod get)
    $ echo $?
    4
    ```
32. Module-internal references: `probes/nested-ref/`
    (`spec: { port: $.defaults.port }`) hashes standalone, and imported
    at a nested consumer key it is refused with `[aontu/no_path]`,
    because `$` is the root of the importing document.
33. The lockfile's `v` is the version `mod.aon` declares: `v: "9.9.9"`
    for a store tree whose own `mod.aon` says `version: "1.4.2"` is
    `verdict: ok` and locks `"v":"9.9.9"`. Integrity rests on the canon
    pin, which is computed from the store.

## Run

```
./check.sh          # 33 assertions, exits 0
```

`check.sh` uses a private `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, never touches the real
user cache, and runs from any cwd. `AONTU` may be overridden to point
at another build.
