# Minimal reproductions

One directory per defect family; every entry is indexed and explained
in [../BUGS.md](../BUGS.md). Each `.aon` file carries an
`# expected:` / `# actual:` header (and, where needed, the exact
command in an `# run:` line). Run any of them with:

```sh
node ../../ts/bin/aontu.js <file>       # or the command in # run:
```

Two cautions:

- `refer-cycles/refer-in-type-hang.aon` (with its `-schema` companion)
  and `recursion/recursive-spread-conjunct-hangs.aon` do not terminate
  in any practical time — run them under `timeout` as their headers
  say. `identity/id-names-own-descendant-crashes.aon` used to belong
  beside them, terminating only by overflowing the host stack (in Go a
  `fatal error` the embedding program cannot recover from); §58 is
  fixed and it now refuses as `id_ancestor`. `run-all.sh` never
  executes anything in this tree.
- Some entries reproduce **by-design** behaviour whose consequence is
  the finding (marked in their headers and in BUGS.md), and
  `enum-default/match-helper-workaround.aon` is deliberately the
  *working* spelling, kept beside the failing ones.
- The whole `enum-default/` family is **FIXED** as of 2026-08-26 by
  the preference admission gate (ADR-004): each header records the
  new behaviour and the shared spec rows that pin it, and BUGS.md
  §1–5 carry Status lines.
- The whole `generator-seal/` family, `sibling-crosswire/`'s
  close/rank-pref halves (`close-key-pack.aon`,
  `rankpref-key-pack.aon`), and `pack-refs/`'s re-anchoring entries
  (`rel-ref-in-expr.aon`, `nested-pack-hole.aon`,
  `spread-expr-sibling.aon`, `hide-computed-drop.aon`) are **FIXED**
  as of 2026-08-26 by the template-clone isolation change (ADR-005):
  headers record the new behaviour and the pinning rows, and BUGS.md
  §8–12, §33–35 carry Status lines.
- The rest of both families is **FIXED** as of 2026-08-26 by the
  spread application rework (ADR-006): the unequal-spread crosswire
  (§6, §7 — `idmerge-ref-templates.aon`, `oneview-ref-templates.aon`,
  `two-spreads*.aon`), the self-referential merge expression (§36,
  `merge-expr-onto-pack-child.aon`), and the generator over
  spread-augmented data (`spread-then-pack.aon`). Headers record the
  new behaviour; the durable pins are the `spread-interleave.tsv`
  spread-unequal-* composition matrix, `gen-pack.tsv`/`gen-each.tsv`
  *-over-spread-augmented and pack-merge-expr-onto-child, `plus.tsv`
  peer-key-expr*, and `vet.tsv` vet-unequal-spread-depths.

- The three defects that fixing §44 surfaced are **FIXED** as of
  2026-08-28, and each has a header recording what changed:
  `diagnostics/pair-before-spread-dropped.aon` (§46, the `elem` rule's
  spread guard), `diagnostics/container-conflict-member-path.aon` with
  its `-map` companion (§47 and an unreported map twin, the container's
  own slot restored before the refusal), and
  `constraint-compose/composed-alias-atom-dropped.aon` (§48, regraded
  from minor to critical — the canon of a composed constraint dropped
  the atom added at the point of use, in BOTH ports). Their pins are
  `spread-list.tsv`, the new `container-path.tsv`, and
  `constraint-alias.tsv`.

- `includes/` (§49, filed 2026-08-28) is **FIXED** as of 2026-08-30,
  by the ruling in ADR-012: `.aon` and `.aontu` are read as aontu
  source, ten config formats (`.json`, `.jsonld`, `.jsonc`, `.json5`,
  `.jsonic`, `.jsc`, `.toml`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.ini`) are read as
  data by their own parsers, and every other one — and a name with no
  extension — is refused by name. Both entries need a
  fixture beside them, so the directory carries `vocab.json` and
  `vocab.jsonld` — byte-identical, differing only in name, which was
  the whole point. Their pin is `file.tsv`, the `load-ext-*` block.

- `key-func/` (§50, filed 2026-08-28) is **FIXED** as of 2026-08-30,
  and Go was right. It was found by removing `.$KEY` (ADR-009): the
  only test covering a spread template read through a deep reference
  used that spelling, whose different code path hid a live parity
  break in `key()`. What settled it is that Go's four-level answer is
  the agreed three-level answer one level deeper, character for
  character — so the TypeScript refusal was the defect, not a reading.
  The apply-once mark on a spread is by template identity, and every
  value takes a fresh id when constructed, so a reference cloning a
  templated bag defeated it; a template now keeps a stable identity
  across clones. The row set is the depth ladder itself,
  `gen-key.tsv` `key-spread-through-ref-2..5`.

- `recursion/` (§52, filed 2026-08-28) is fixed (2026-08-29, P0+P1);
  what remains open in that directory is §57, the recursive spread
  conjoined with a map, which does not terminate. It was a design
  question rather than a patch: every spelling of a recursive schema
  is refused (`path_cycle`), broken at depth one (`scalar_kind` naming
  neither the recursion nor the schema), or silently vacuous (the
  spread-template spelling generates at any depth and checks nothing).
  The design is written: `docs/design/RECURSION.0.md`.

- `order/` (§62, filed 2026-08-30) is **FIXED** as of 2026-08-30:
  `bagChildren` sorts with `cmpCodePoint`, so `pick` answers in the
  same order as `each` and as the map's own canon, in both ports.
  Pinned by `agg.tsv` — `pick-astral-key-order`,
  `each-astral-key-order` and `pick-astral-key-order-three`.

- `anchor/` (§59, filed 2026-08-30) is **FIXED** as of 2026-08-30: an
  absolute reference the anchored meet's root cannot answer falls back
  to the settled schema root in BOTH ports (Go's walk now reads
  `Ctx.fixroot`, as TypeScript's `RefVal.find` reads `_fixroot`), and
  both stamp that settled root so the schema site names its file.
  Pinned by `vet.tsv` — `vet-at-alias-chain-valid`, `-inner-kind` and
  `-inner-closed`.

- `identity/` (§58, filed 2026-08-30) is **FIXED** as of 2026-08-30:
  an `id()` naming a node and its own descendant is refused as
  `id_ancestor` (class conflict) in both ports, instead of building a
  value that contains itself and dying on the host stack. Pinned by
  `id.tsv` — `id-ancestor-names-own-child`,
  `-names-deeper-descendant`, and the three boundary rows that keep
  siblings, distinct names and a bare `id()` working.

- `includes-root/` (§93, filed 2026-09-11) is **FIXED** as of
  2026-09-11: a root-level include of a DATA file merges its keys into
  the map that holds it in the Go port too, instead of contributing
  nothing, and one whose value is not a map is refused in both ports
  rather than ignored in one. Pinned by `file.tsv` — the `load-root-*`
  rows.

- `op-template/` (§92, filed 2026-09-11) is **FIXED** as of
  2026-09-11: an op DRIVES the meet while an operand has not decided,
  at a key inside a map as well as in a conjunct, which is the rule a
  staged call already had. Pinned by `edge.tsv` —
  `edge-plus-op-under-map-template`, `-map-kind` and `-map-value`.

These are review artifacts. Per ADR-001, the durable home for any
behaviour contract is a `test/spec/*.tsv` row probed in both ports;
promoting these repros into rows is follow-up work for maintainers.
