#    anything? --strict-coverage exits 1 on a check that constrained no
#    value, which is the failure a passing gate hides.

# 2. What does it say at a path?

# 3. Why does it say that? Every contribution, with the line it is on.

# 4. A pin for the truth: it survives reformatting and moves on any
#    change of meaning.
