NEW TO THE LANGUAGE? This page documents the TOOL. The documentation
of the LANGUAGE travels inside this binary, and this is how to reach it:

  aontu help              List the topics this binary carries
  aontu help tasks        Which verb does the job you have
  aontu help language     The whole grammar, on one page
  aontu help examples     The ladder, from plain JSON upward
  aontu help codes        What a refusal means
  aontu help grammar      The published ABNF
  aontu explain <code>    What one error code a report carries means
  aontu explain --list    Every registered code with its class

Every one of those answers with no network and no checkout. The
long-form documentation -- the tutorial, the language and API
references, the how-to guides -- is in docs/ of the repository, which
is where to go when the topics above are not enough; the contributor
and agent guide is AGENTS.md beside it.

The one construct to know before writing anything: &: inside a map is
a TEMPLATE that every key of that map must satisfy. A quoted "*" is a
key named *, not a wildcard, and a schema written that way constrains
nothing while still reporting valid.

The vet verb validates data documents against a schema document and
reports what does not hold, as text or as a machine-readable object.

The subsume verb asks whether every instance the specific document
admits, the general document admits too. The breaking verb runs that
query between a document and its own earlier versions.

Options:
  -c, --canon     Print the canonical form instead of generated JSON
  -h, --help      Show this help and exit (the verbs and their flags);
                  aontu help is the LANGUAGE, and lists its own topics
  --jsonl         REPL: answer every command as one JSON line
  -v, --version   Print the version and exit
  --trust <t>     Include capability: system (default), none, or
                  root[:dir] to confine @"..." below a directory.
                  Every verb takes it too, and a bare root means the
                  document's own directory
  --include-root <dir>  Shorthand for --trust root:<dir>
  --text-ext <e>  Read these extensions as text too, comma-separated
                  and without dots (md,sql). .txt needs no flag; a
                  named format keeps its meaning, and .js stays
                  refused. Every verb takes it

Mod options:
  --format <f>    text (default) or json
  --against <dir> manifest: a prior version's module tree, to gate on

Mod subcommands:
  tidy      Resolve the module closure by minimum version selection and
            rewrite aontu_meta/mod-lock.aon in canonical form
  verify    Check every locked module still means what the lockfile
            pins, and change nothing (the CI gate; tidy rewrites)
  vendor    Materialise the locked closure into aontu_meta/vendor/
  manifest  Print the OCI artifact a publish would push, gated on the
            breaking check against --against

Vet options:
  --at <path>       Validate against this path of the schema ($.a.b)
  --closed          Refuse keys the anchor does not declare
  --partial         Residue is reported but does not fail the run
  --max-errors <n>  Cap the finding list (default 20)
  --coverage        Report what the check EXAMINED: how many data
                    leaves a schema declaration constrained, the
                    shallowest data paths none did, and the
                    declarations no data met
  --strict-coverage --coverage, and exit 1 when the run was VACUOUS --
                    when no data leaf was constrained at all. The
                    verdict word is unchanged, so nothing that passes
                    today starts failing without this flag
  --coverage-at <p> Measure coverage under this path of the data only
  --format <f>      text (default), json or sarif
  --watch           Re-run whenever a watched file changes

A check that examined NOTHING and a check that passed answer the same
without --coverage. The usual cause is a schema written with the
wildcard other tools use: a quoted "*" is a key NAMED *, not a
template, so it constrains nothing and the run still reports valid.
The template is &: -- see aontu help language.

Vet exit codes:
  0  valid       data unifies, and is concrete (or --partial)
  1  invalid     at least one contradiction, or a vacuous run under
                 --strict-coverage
  2  usage       bad option, or a file that cannot be read
  3  incomplete  no contradiction, but the truth is not yet satisfied
  4  error       the schema is unusable on its own

Subsume options:
  --profile <p>   values, defaults (default) or gen
  --at <path>     Compare at this path of both documents ($.a.b)
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Subsume exit codes:
  0  subsumes          every specific instance is admitted
  1  does_not_subsume  a witness exists (see the findings)
  2  usage             bad option, or a file that cannot be read
  3  undecided         no rule decides (a sub_* reason is reported)
  4  error             a document does not stand up on its own

Breaking options:
  --against <v>       An earlier version: a file path, or git#<rev>
                      (resolved by 'git show'); repeatable
  --at <path>         Compare this path of both versions ($.a.b), so a
                      module's own version string and policy block do
                      not decide the verdict
  --mode <m>          backward (new admits old, the default), forward
                      (old admits new), or full (both); overrides the
                      document's own $.aontu_policy.compat declaration
  --allow-undecided   Exit 0 on undecided (the report still says so)
  --allow-deprecated-removal
                      A finding about a value the old version already
                      deprecated warns instead of breaking
  --format <f>        text (default) or json

Breaking exit codes mirror subsume's: 0 compatible, 1 breaking,
2 usage, 3 undecided, 4 error.

Trim options:
  --check         Report redundant entries as paths (required: trim
                  only reports for now; rewriting is a future editor)
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Trim exit codes: 0 nothing redundant, 1 redundancies reported,
2 usage, 4 the document does not stand up on its own.

Hash options:
  --form          Print the hash FORM (the hashed text) instead of the
                  hash, which is what to diff when a pin moves
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Hash exit codes: 0 hashed, 2 usage, 4 the document does not stand up
on its own.

Get options:
  -c, --canon     Canonical-form fragment (default: generated JSON)
  --keys          Keys at the node, one per line
  --types         Shape view: concrete leaves lifted to their kinds
  --depth <n>     Structure to depth n; deeper nodes render as top
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Get exit codes: 0 rendered, 1 the path names nothing, 2 usage, 4 the
document does not stand up on its own.

Why options:
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Why exit codes mirror get's: 0 explained, 1 the path names nothing,
2 usage, 4 the document does not stand up on its own.

View kinds: doc, lattice, tree, matrix, graph, layer, sets, layers,
ladder, poset (the poset takes several files). The figure goes to stdout, the loss
report to stderr. With --views it draws every figure a document
declares as data, from one evaluation: each declaration names its own
kind and out file, nothing is written unless every figure rendered,
and --check gates the committed set.

View options:
  --as <profile>    text | mermaid | dot | er | svg, per kind: doc,
                    lattice, tree, matrix, sets and layers draw text
                    (default) or svg; graph draws mermaid (default),
                    dot or er; layer draws text (default), mermaid or
                    svg; ladder and poset draw mermaid (default) or dot
  --at <path>       Restrict the figure to nodes under this path; the
                    subtree doc draws; the subtree the lattice counts;
                    the path the ladder draws; where the poset compares
  --views <path>    Draw every figure the document declares at this
                    path, one evaluation, all or nothing; each
                    declaration names its own kind and out file
  -o, --out <file>  Write the figure here instead of stdout
  --check           Exit 1 if --out differs from what would be drawn;
                    nothing is written
  --strict          Exit 1 when the loss report holds anything beyond
                    edges_deduped, inverse_suppressed and crossings
  --depth <n>       doc: how many levels of key to draw (default 3)
  --max-rows <n>    Refuse a figure above this many rows (default 60)
  --style <s>       auto (default), none, ansi or css. A figure's
                    marks carry their meaning -- a direct cell, a
                    closure cell, an upward edge -- and each profile
                    has one way to show it: SGR escapes for text, CSS
                    classes for svg. auto picks that mechanism where
                    the destination can carry it: escapes only on a
                    terminal (NO_COLOR is honoured), and an svg keeps
                    the stylesheet that makes it standalone. none
                    drops both; on svg the classes stay and only the
                    stylesheet goes, for a host page that has already
                    bound --av-ink and its kin. Escapes are never
                    written to a file
  --format <f>      text (default) or json, the whole report
  --relation <n>    tree, matrix, layer: draw over this relation only;
                    graph: keep this predicate (repeatable)
  --root <path>     tree: draw only the subtree under this node;
                    repeatable
  --order <o>       matrix: canon (default) or partition
  --closure         matrix: mark transitively reachable cells +
  --group-by <k>    graph: one subgraph per distinct value of field k;
                    layer: one band per value (required)
  --layers <a,b>    layer: the bands in this order, top first; without
                    it the order is derived from the relation
  --edges <e>       layer: which of the relation's edges to draw over
                    the bands -- upward (the violations, the default
                    for text and svg), all (mermaid's default) or none
  --label <k>       graph: label each node with field k
  --sets <path>     sets: the map whose keys are the sets
  --member <k>      sets: the field holding each set's members
  --universe <p>    sets: the full element domain, so the empty
                    column exists
  --min-degree <n>  sets: drop intersections below this degree
  --min-size <n>    layers: drop intersections below this many paths
  --max-cols <n>    sets, layers: elide columns beyond this many
  --profile <p>     poset: values | defaults (default) | gen

View exit codes: 0 rendered, 1 --check mismatch or lossy under
--strict, 2 usage or --max-rows exceeded, 4 the document does not stand
up on its own, or a relation, root or path that names nothing.

Render options:
  --at <path>       Render the value at this path ($.a.b); the root by
                    default
  --profile <file>  A profile document, profile: {lang, ...}, vetted
                    against aontu:profile; repeatable, one per language
  --unit <path>     Render only the unit with this path
  --stdout          One unit's bytes and nothing else (with --unit when
                    the instance has several)
  --out <dir>       Write every unit below dir, or nothing; never deletes
  --check <dir>     Compare every unit with dir/<path>; drift is listed
  --coverage        Report what the render read and what it did not:
                    model paths no output consumed, and rendered
                    declarations no rule produced. Writes nothing
  --coverage-at <p> Measure coverage under this path only, instead of
                    the document root
  --strict          Refuse the opaque escapes (a text declaration, a raw
                    block)
  --format <f>      text (default) or json, the whole report; json
                    carries the dispatch trace, one entry per emitted
                    piece

Render exit codes: 0 rendered, 1 lossy under --strict or drift under
--check, 2 usage or I/O (a refused unit path included), 4 the document
does not stand up or the instance is not aontu:code.

A render entry file whose extension is not .aon is a TEMPLATE: a
generator in the target's own syntax, whose marker lines carry aontu
and whose other lines are output. It is desugared before it is
evaluated, and --marker names the marker for a language the table does
not know.

Template options:
  --resugar       The file is the canonical aontu; print the template
                  form instead of reading one
  --check         Desugar and resugar, and exit 1 if the file is not
                  what the round trip answers
  --marker <t>    The marker, when the extension does not name it
                  (default //-, and #- --- /*- by extension)

The template verb prints the canonical aontu form of a generator
written in the target's own syntax: a marked line is aontu source, and
every other line is a line of output.

Template exit codes: 0 written, 1 --check drift, 2 usage or I/O.

Set options:
  --entry <file>    The document the change is checked against
  --overlay <file>  The file the change is appended to (created if
                    absent; not written when the change does not hold)
  --in-place        Rewrite a pinned literal where it was written,
                    instead of appending a line that contradicts it.
                    The span is verified against the source text
                    before writing, and where the value is not a
                    single editable literal in this overlay the
                    assignment is appended as usual with a warning
                    saying why
  --dry-run         Print the overlay that would be written, write
                    nothing
  --format <f>      text (default) or json

Set exit codes are vet's verdict classes: 0 valid, 1 invalid (the
change contradicts a pinned value -- aontu why locates it, and
--in-place rewrites it), 2 usage, 3 incomplete, 4 the entry does not
stand up on its own.

Agentsmd options:
  --write <file>  Splice the stanza into this file between the
                  aontu:begin and aontu:end markers, appending them
                  when they are absent; the rest is left alone

Agentsmd exit codes: 0 generated, 2 usage, 4 the document does not
stand up on its own.

Help options:
  --format <f>    text (default) or json, the topic and its text

The help verb prints the embedded teaching pack: the language, not the
tool. With no topic it lists them. Topics are tasks, language,
examples, codes and grammar; the corpus is generated from docs/skill/
and grammar/aontu.abnf, so it cannot drift from those sources.

Help exit codes: 0 printed, 2 an unknown topic (the topics are listed)
or a bad option.

Explain options:
  --list          Every registered error code with its class
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

The explain verb answers what one error code means, from the same
table the engine attaches to a finding. Every registered code has an
entry, so a code read out of a report always resolves.

Explain exit codes: 0 explained, 2 an unknown code (near matches are
named) or a bad option.

Fmt options:
  -w, --write     Rewrite each file in place, when its form would change
  -l, --list      Print the name of each file whose form would change
  --check         Like --list, and exit 1 when any would: the CI gate
  -d, --diff      Print a unified diff for each file whose form would
                  change
  --lint          Report the style findings, key case and repeated
                  shapes, on standard error, and print nothing else
  --strict        With --lint, and exit 1 when there is a finding
  --marker <t>    The file is a generator, and this is its marker
                  (default //-, and #- --- /*- by extension)

The fmt verb prints one document in the agreed form; with no file it
reads standard input. Several files need one of the options above.

A file whose extension is not .aon is a GENERATOR, as it is for render:
the aontu its marker lines carry is formatted, the marker stands at the
left margin with the aontu indented after it, and every line of output
is held on a line of its own. A file with no marker line in it is
another language's, and is refused.

Fmt exit codes: 0 formatted or clean, 1 a --check file would change or
a --strict finding, 2 usage, 4 a document does not parse.

The lsp verb runs the language server over standard input and output
(LSP: JSON-RPC with Content-Length framing) until the client exits;
editors launch it with no arguments. The standalone aontu-lsp binary
runs the same server.

The mcp verb runs the Model Context Protocol server over standard
input and output (newline-delimited JSON-RPC), confined below --root
when one is given. It is part of the npm build, as the standalone
aontu-mcp binary is.
