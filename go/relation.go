// RELATION GRAPH VERDICTS (RELATIONS.0.md §3.3, replacing the G4
// phase 5 magic-key pass; the Go side of ts/src/relation.ts):
// acyclicity and inverse consistency over the edge set, DECLARED by
// the graph atoms -- `acyclic()` and `inverse(name)` conjoined at the
// field whose key is the predicate -- and decided AFTER unification,
// never by it.
//
// Why not in the lattice. Both properties are GLOBAL and NON-MONOTONE:
// an acyclic graph becomes cyclic when one more edge unifies in, and an
// inverse that is present becomes absent when the far side is narrowed.
// The lattice guarantee is that more information never falsifies what
// has been observed, so a constraint that could be true and then false
// is not a constraint the lattice may hold. The atoms therefore only
// REGISTER during unification (GraphAtomVal.register, onto
// Ctx.reldecls), and the verdict lands at GENERATION -- the sizing
// atoms' model -- where no more information can arrive. The
// `relations` verb reports the same verdict from the same
// declarations: one decision, two surfaces. The old `relations:`
// magic key is GONE, discharging ADR-010's grandfather clause.

// RelationFinding is one broken relation property.
// Field order is LEXICOGRAPHIC, the canonical emitter's order — the
// TypeScript port's exactJSON sorts keys, and a report is read by a
// machine that diffs it.

	// declarations means nothing was checked, and without this the two

	// that carries the meaning; nil is "the run did not ask", &0 is
