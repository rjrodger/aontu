// RELATION GRAPH CHECKS (G4 phase 5,
// docs/capability-review/g4-identity-relations.md, and the Go side of
// ts/src/relation.ts): acyclicity and inverse consistency over the edge
// set, checked AFTER unification and never by it.
//
// Why not in the lattice. Both properties are GLOBAL and NON-MONOTONE:
// an acyclic graph becomes cyclic when one more edge unifies in, and an
// inverse that is present becomes absent when the far side is narrowed.
// The lattice guarantee is that more information never falsifies what
// has been observed, so a constraint that could be true and then false
// is not a constraint the lattice may hold.
//
// A relation is DECLARED as data, under the `relations` key of the
// document root, which is the `std/system` vocabulary's convention.
// Nothing in the engine knows that name; this pass does, and says so.

// RelationFinding is one broken relation property.
// Field order is LEXICOGRAPHIC, the canonical emitter's order — the
// TypeScript port's exactJSON sorts keys, and a report is read by a
// machine that diffs it.
