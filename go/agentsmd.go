// generated FROM the definition, so the prose entrypoint cannot drift
// from the formal source it points at.
//
// A hand-written "here is where the config lives" paragraph is stale
// the first time a key is renamed. This one is derived: the root keys
// come from the document, the pin from G6's canon-hash, and the
// commands are spelled with paths that exist.
