// THE PROVENANCE RECORDER (G7 phase 4, the Go side of
// ts/src/provenance.ts): what CONTRIBUTED to the value at a path, in
// order, with the site each contribution was written at. `why` is the
// positive twin of G2's error report — errors explain what failed to
// unify, this explains what did.
//
// The recorder rides the CONTEXT and is off by default: unite pays one
// nil check on the normal path, and an instrumented run pays site
// materialisation knowingly. It records at unite and nowhere else,
// because that is the one place every meet passes through — the same
// reason G3's deprecation rider lives there.
