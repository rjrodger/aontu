//
// Wrapping the nil in a map to survive the merge does NOT work either, and
// the reason is worth recording so it is not attempted again: the plugin's
// mergeIntoParent copies the loaded value's keys into the parent one by one,
// so a wrapper carrying its own order list OVERWRITES the parent's and
// destroys the sibling keys -- while a wrapper without one is skipped by
// asValDepth, which converts only the keys the order list names.
//
// Recording at the point of DETECTION cannot be undone by anything
// downstream: no merge, no unification and no disjunction pruning can drop a
// fact that was never in the tree.
//
// The bag holds a POINTER (notFoundSink), not the message, so that a failure
// found inside a NESTED include propagates back to the entry parse -- see
// notFoundSink for why a plain value silently does not.
//
// The key carries the reserved sentinel prefix (see reservedKeyPrefix in
// lang.go) for the reason that prefix exists -- it shares a namespace with
// keys a source could otherwise write, and sources using the prefix are
// already refused.
const notFoundMetaKey = reservedKeyPrefix + "notfound"

// notFoundSink is the shared accumulator a parse hands to the resolver
// through the meta bag. It is a POINTER for the reason the whole mechanism
// works: the multisource plugin builds a nested parse's meta with a SHALLOW
// COPY of its parent's (childMeta), so every source in an include chain --
// at any depth -- ends up holding this same pointer, and a write from the
// deepest one is visible to the entry parse that allocated it.
//
// A plain string value in the bag is NOT enough, and that was the first
// version of this fix: it caught a bad include in the ENTRY source only.
// When the entry loaded a file that itself contained a bad bare-member
// include, the write landed in the child's copy of the map, the entry never
// saw it, and Go generated an incomplete document while TypeScript
// correctly refused. Found in review; the fixtures under
// test/spec/files/nest_missing*.aon pin it.
//
// Not synchronised, and does not need to be: the sink is allocated per
// parseBase call and a single parse runs on one goroutine. It never
// escapes to the cached, shared *jsonic.Jsonic.
// It carries the CODE as well as the message: a load can fail for two
// reasons that need different names -- the source was not there
// (multisource_not_found) or its extension is not read as Aontu source
// (include_extension, see includeKinds) -- and both have to reach
// parseBase through this one channel, for the same bare-member reason.
