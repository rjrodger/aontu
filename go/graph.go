// THE DERIVED STRUCTURES (G4 phase 3,
// docs/capability-review/g4-identity-relations.md, and the Go side of
// ts/src/graph.ts): an evaluated document has, besides its value, a
// GRAPH — an entity index (id → the tree paths that hold it) and an
// edge set (the checked links, each from one entity to one address).
//
// G4's deliverable is that these exist and are DETERMINISTIC. What is
// built on them — impact analysis ("what reaches svc/auth?"),
// reachability, context-window-sized entity slices — is a traversal,
// and its exposure as verbs and projections belongs to G7. Relation
// properties (acyclicity, inverse consistency) are G4 phase 5's, and
// consume exactly this edge set.

// EntityEntry is one id and every tree path that holds it. More than
// one path is the normal case: the merge puts the entity's value at
// every position that declared it.

	// ancestor, or "" for a link outside every entity. This is the
	// entity/component distinction: a node without an id is a component
	// of its nearest identified ancestor.
	From string `json:"from"`
	// Key is the RELATION: the nearest map key on the way down from the
	// entity, so a link inside a list (`dependsOn: [&: refer(),
	// svc/auth]`) is an edge under `dependsOn` rather than under `0`.
	Key string `json:"key"`
	// To is the address, as the link spells it.
	To string `json:"to"`
