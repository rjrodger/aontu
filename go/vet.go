package aontu

// The validation verb: check a data document against a schema document
// and return a MACHINE-READABLE report. The Go port of ts/src/vet.ts
// (G2 phase 4, docs/capability-review/g2-validation-verb.md), engine
// only — the command line, its renderers and its exit codes live in
// cmd/aontu, as they do in ts/src/cli.ts.
//
// Two properties of the engine shape everything here, and both are the
// canonical implementation's, probed rather than assumed:
//
//   - A CONTRADICTION surfaces as a NilVal in the unified tree, so
//     conflict findings come from a tree walk (walk.go), plus the nils
//     that never made it into the tree.
//   - INCOMPLETENESS does not. `{name:"auth"}` against
//     `{name:string, port:integer}` unifies cleanly and leaves
//     `port:integer` standing — no nil, no error. It surfaces only when
//     something tries to GENERATE, which is why vet runs a generate
//     check in an isolated collect context and reads the
//     `incomplete`-class errors out of it. The two verdicts the report
//     distinguishes therefore come from two different mechanisms.
//
// WHAT IS IN CROSS-PORT PARITY. Everything the report carries except
// the message: verdict, truncation, and each finding's code, class,
// severity, path, sites (file, row, column, role, value) and the
// expected/actual/note the constraint algebra attaches. The message is
// the nil's HEADLINE, which the two ports already hold to byte parity
// (NilVal.Headline, val.go) — but it stays prose, and prose is not
// contractual across the ports (test/spec/divergent.tsv), so the shared
// suite's goldens exclude it.
