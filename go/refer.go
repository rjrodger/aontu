// CHECKED, TYPED, LINK-SHAPED REFERENCES (G4 phase 2,
// docs/capability-review/g4-identity-relations.md, and the Go side of
// ts/src/val/ReferFuncVal.ts): `refer(t)` is a constraint on a
// string-valued field. The string must be an ENTITY ADDRESS, the
// addressed node must exist in the evaluation, and — when `t` is given
// — `t` is unified INTO the target. The field's own value stays the
// address string: a LINK, not an embedding.
//
// This is the piece a plain reference cannot be. `$.a.b` resolves by
// CLONING its target into place, so `dependsOn: [$.services.auth]`
// generates a full copy of the auth node where the author meant a
// name. `refer` leaves the name and checks it.

// Address is a TREE PATH, in the two spellings a reference uses:
// `$.services.auth` from the document root, `.auth` from the link's own
// sibling scope. The tree is the only namespace (ADR-014) -- which is
// what makes a model instantiable more than once, each instance
// resolving its relative links inside itself. Mirrors Address in
