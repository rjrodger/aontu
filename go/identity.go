// that the enclosing value is an independent ENTITY named `name`, and
// every node in one evaluation carrying that name is unified with every
// other. The Go side of ts/src/val/IdFuncVal.ts and the mergeEntities
// pass in ts/src/unify.ts.

// idNameOK reports whether s spells an entity name: letters, digits,
// `_`, `-`, `/` — and NO DOTS, because a dot separates an entity
// address from a sub-path (G4 phase 2), so a dotted id would make
// `svc/auth.port` ambiguous between "the entity `svc/auth.port`" and
// "the port of `svc/auth`". Written as an explicit loop rather than a
// regexp so the two ports cannot drift on a character class.

// ordinary conflict naming both sites.
//
// Run once per fixpoint pass, after the pass's own unification: a
// position picks up the representative, the representative picks up the
// position, and the two converge across passes exactly as chained
// references do, inside the same pass budget.
//
// The tree stays a TREE. Every declared position holds the merged value
// and generation emits it at each path — duplication, as references
// generate today. Identity adds addressing, not a new shape.
//
// COLLECT, then APPLY — the same walk twice, not two walks. A single
// pass merges each position into the representative as it meets it,
// which leaves the positions it already passed holding the pre-merge
// value: `a: id(x) & {k:1}` kept `{k:1}` while `b: id(x) & {j:2}`
