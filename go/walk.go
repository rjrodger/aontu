// One tree walk, three consumers: Check collects NilVals for the LSP's
// diagnostics (check.go), and the validation verb both stamps
// provenance and collects NilVals for findings (vet.go). The Go twin of
// ts/src/walk.ts, and written for the same reason: one traversal, not
// three copies of something with three easy ways to be subtly wrong.
//
// The `seen` set is a termination guard, not an optimisation: a
// unified tree is a graph (a resolved ref shares its target, a spread
// shares its template), so an unguarded walk does not terminate.
//
// The visitor returns false to prune the subtree below a node, which is
// how a nil collector stops at the nil rather than walking into the
// operands it carries.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS A CHILD. TypeScript reads `v.peg` generically -- an
// array for lists, conjuncts, disjuncts and funcs, an object for maps
// -- plus the off-peg `spread.cj`. Go has no generic peg, so the kinds
// are named here; the list is setPaths' list (clone.go), which is the
// other place that has to reach every value a parse produced.

// stampURL names the source every value in a tree came from. Values

// say which of them each site belongs to -- and, before that, which
// text the site's row and column are offsets into.
//
// Stamped BEFORE the two trees meet, which is what makes the answer
// provenance rather than a guess: after unification the values are
// interleaved, and no property of a value distinguishes them.

// NilVals.
//
// The walk stops AT a nil rather than descending into it: the operands
// it carries are the failure's inputs, not further failures.
//
// The `seen` set is the caller's, not an internal detail: both callers
// go on to dedup context-only errors against the nils already found,
// which is only possible if they hold the set.
