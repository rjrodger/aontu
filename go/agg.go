// AGGREGATION, PROJECTION AND THE STRING FOLD: sum(d), least(d),
// greatest(d), pick(d, k) and join(d, sep?) (the Go side of
// ts/src/val/AggFuncVal.ts).
//
// The review's finding I: "No aggregation. length() counts but nothing
// sums: an invoice total, a fleet-wide resource budget, a quota roll-up
// -- all inexpressible." Use case 10 had to write totals by hand and
// spot-check them with must(), which is a model asserting what it should
// be able to COMPUTE.
//
// A FOLD OVER A FINITE, SETTLED BAG IS AS TOTAL AS each. There is no
// recursion and no user-supplied step: the bag is the one the model
// already holds, the operation is fixed, and the walk visits each child
// exactly once. That is why these are built-ins rather than a fold
// combinator -- a fold takes a function, and a language with no user
// functions has none to take.
//
// THE NAMES ARE least AND greatest, NOT min AND max, which are already
// the constraint atoms for a lower and an upper BOUND. See the
// TypeScript twin's header for the rest of the reasoning: sum folds with
// add so the number tower's law comes with it, sum([]) is 0 because
// addition has an identity, and least/greatest refuse an empty bag
// because comparison has none.

// isBag reports whether a value has children to fold. bagChildren
// (constraint.go, where `unique` already needed the same walk) lists
// them in the order the aggregate sees: source order for a list,
// sorted-key order for a map -- each's order, and for the same reason (a
// map has no order of its own, so the language picks one and states it).
// It asserts its argument is one of the two, so the check is here.

// THE FOLD TO A STRING: join(coll, sep?) -- G9 phase 2.
//
// The one primitive between a model and a generated file. A spread can
// put a separator AFTER each element; putting one BETWEEN N elements is
// a reduction over strings, and the language had none: sum is numeric,
// `+` does not reduce a list, and indexed concatenation needs the arity
// known in advance. So a generated SQL column list carried a trailing
// comma and did not parse (use-cases/15-code-generation).
//
// IT FOLDS WITH `+` SEEDED WITH "", exactly as sum folds with add seeded
// with 0. Not a figure of speech: members are rendered by primStr, which
// IS what `+`'s string branch calls (exactPlus in op.go), so the
// language keeps one answer to "how does a number become text". See the
// TypeScript twin's header for the rest -- join(coll) is concatenation
// so no concat is needed, the empty bag is "" because concatenation has
// an identity, and members are validated BEFORE the fold because `+`
// with a string on the left residuates on a container rather than
// refusing.

// settled value it never can, or something not settled yet.
