// THE BUNDLED VOCABULARY (G4 phase 4,
// docs/capability-review/g4-identity-relations.md): `@"std/system"` is
// served from the engine itself — no filesystem, no package resolution
// — so a document may use it under every include capability except
// `none`, and the hermeticity posture is not widened by a source that
// never leaves the process.
//
// The TEXT is the shared artifact: go/std.go carries the same bytes,
// and test/spec/std-system.tsv pins its canon and its canon-hash in
// both engines, so the two copies cannot drift without a red suite.
// It carries no backtick for that reason: one string literal per port,
// and Go's raw string has no escape.

const STD_SYSTEM = `# std/system --- the SYSTEM VOCABULARY (G4 phase 4). Ports, components
# and relations need no syntax: they are schemas. Everything here is
# ordinary unification --- conjunction, spreads, marks, defaults ---
# so the vocabulary costs the language nothing, and an author who wants
# a different one writes it the same way.
#
# EXPERIMENTAL until the distribution layer can version it by
# canon-hash. Entity ids deliberately do NOT embed versions: fusing
# identity and version makes "v1 and v2 describe the same entity"
# inexpressible.

  # A node with ports. A Component that is not itself an entity is a
  # component OF its nearest identified ancestor, which is the
  # entity/component distinction and needs no mark of its own.

  # A component that is a service. Written out rather than as
  # $.std.Component & {kind: service}: a reference from one member of
  # this file to another does not survive being INCLUDED into a
  # document (the marks the include carries make the referring member
  # unusable), so the vocabulary states each schema on its own.

  # A DECLARED RELATION. "target" is what the far end must satisfy,
  # "inverse" names the relation that must mirror it, and "acyclic"
  # asks that the edge set have no cycle. The last two are checked
  # AFTER unification, not by it: they are global and non-monotone ---
  # an acyclic graph becomes cyclic when one more edge unifies in ---
  # and no lattice citizen may be falsified by more information.
