// THE DERIVED STRUCTURES (G4 phase 3,
// docs/capability-review/g4-identity-relations.md): an evaluated
// document has, besides its value, a GRAPH — an entity index (id → the
// tree paths that hold it) and an edge set (the checked links, each
// from one entity to one address).
//
// G4's deliverable is that these exist and are DETERMINISTIC. What is
// built on them — impact analysis ("what reaches svc/auth?"),
// reachability, context-window-sized entity slices — is a traversal,
// and its exposure as verbs and projections belongs to G7. Relation
// properties (acyclicity, inverse consistency) are G4 phase 5's, and
// consume exactly this edge set.
