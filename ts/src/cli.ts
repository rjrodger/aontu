Evaluate an aontu source file and print the result as JSON.
With no file on an interactive terminal, start a REPL.
With no file and piped input, read the source from stdin.

The vet verb validates data documents against a schema document and
reports what does not hold, as text or as a machine-readable object.

The subsume verb asks whether every instance the specific document
admits, the general document admits too. The breaking verb runs that
query between a document and its own earlier versions.

Options:
  -c, --canon     Print the canonical form instead of generated JSON
  -h, --help      Show this help and exit
  --jsonl         REPL: answer every command as one JSON line
  -v, --version   Print the version and exit
  --trust <t>     Include capability: system (default), none, or
                  root[:dir] to confine @"..." below a directory.
                  Every verb takes it too, and a bare root means the
                  document's own directory
  --include-root <dir>  Shorthand for --trust root:<dir>
  --text-ext <e>  Read these extensions as text too, comma-separated
                  and without dots (md,sql). .txt needs no flag; a
                  named format keeps its meaning, and .js stays
                  refused. Every verb takes it

Mod options:
  --format <f>    text (default) or json
  --against <dir> manifest: a prior version's module tree, to gate on

Mod subcommands:
  tidy      Resolve the module closure by minimum version selection and
            rewrite aontu_meta/mod-lock.aon in canonical form
  verify    Check every locked module still means what the lockfile
            pins, and change nothing (the CI gate; tidy rewrites)
  vendor    Materialise the locked closure into aontu_meta/vendor/
  manifest  Print the OCI artifact a publish would push, gated on the
            breaking check against --against

Vet options:
  --at <path>       Validate against this path of the schema ($.a.b)
  --closed          Refuse keys the anchor does not declare
  --partial         Residue is reported but does not fail the run
  --max-errors <n>  Cap the finding list (default 20)
  --format <f>      text (default), json or sarif
  --watch           Re-run whenever a watched file changes

Vet exit codes:
  0  valid       data unifies, and is concrete (or --partial)
  1  invalid     at least one contradiction
  2  usage       bad option, or a file that cannot be read
  3  incomplete  no contradiction, but the truth is not yet satisfied
  4  error       the schema is unusable on its own

Subsume options:
  --profile <p>   values, defaults (default) or gen
  --at <path>     Compare at this path of both documents ($.a.b)
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Subsume exit codes:
  0  subsumes          every specific instance is admitted
  1  does_not_subsume  a witness exists (see the findings)
  2  usage             bad option, or a file that cannot be read
  3  undecided         no rule decides (a sub_* reason is reported)
  4  error             a document does not stand up on its own

Breaking options:
  --against <v>       An earlier version: a file path, or git#<rev>
                      (resolved by 'git show'); repeatable
  --at <path>         Compare this path of both versions ($.a.b), so a
                      module's own version string and policy block do
                      not decide the verdict
  --mode <m>          backward (new admits old, the default), forward
                      (old admits new), or full (both); overrides the
                      document's own $.aontu_policy.compat declaration
  --allow-undecided   Exit 0 on undecided (the report still says so)
  --allow-deprecated-removal
                      A finding about a value the old version already
                      deprecated warns instead of breaking
  --format <f>        text (default) or json

Breaking exit codes mirror subsume's: 0 compatible, 1 breaking,
2 usage, 3 undecided, 4 error.

Trim options:
  --check         Report redundant entries as paths (required: trim
                  only reports for now; rewriting is a future editor)
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Trim exit codes: 0 nothing redundant, 1 redundancies reported,
2 usage, 4 the document does not stand up on its own.

Hash options:
  --form          Print the hash FORM (the hashed text) instead of the
                  hash, which is what to diff when a pin moves
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Hash exit codes: 0 hashed, 2 usage, 4 the document does not stand up
on its own.

Get options:
  -c, --canon     Canonical-form fragment (default: generated JSON)
  --keys          Keys at the node, one per line
  --types         Shape view: concrete leaves lifted to their kinds
  --depth <n>     Structure to depth n; deeper nodes render as top
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Get exit codes: 0 rendered, 1 the path names nothing, 2 usage, 4 the
document does not stand up on its own.

Why options:
  --format <f>    text (default) or json

Why exit codes mirror get's: 0 explained, 1 the path names nothing,
2 usage, 4 the document does not stand up on its own.

View kinds: doc, lattice, tree, matrix, graph, layer, sets, layers,
ladder, poset (the poset takes several files). The figure goes to stdout, the loss
report to stderr. With --views it draws every figure a document
declares as data, from one evaluation: each declaration names its own
kind and out file, nothing is written unless every figure rendered,
and --check gates the committed set.

View options:
  --as <profile>    text | mermaid | dot | er | svg, per kind: doc,
                    lattice, tree, matrix, sets and layers draw text
                    (default) or svg; graph draws mermaid (default),
                    dot or er; layer draws text (default), mermaid or
                    svg; ladder and poset draw mermaid (default) or dot
  --at <path>       Restrict the figure to nodes under this path; the
                    subtree doc draws; the subtree the lattice counts;
                    the path the ladder draws; where the poset compares
  --views <path>    Draw every figure the document declares at this
                    path, one evaluation, all or nothing; each
                    declaration names its own kind and out file
  -o, --out <file>  Write the figure here instead of stdout
  --check           Exit 1 if --out differs from what would be drawn;
                    nothing is written
  --strict          Exit 1 when the loss report holds anything beyond
                    edges_deduped, inverse_suppressed and crossings
  --depth <n>       doc: how many levels of key to draw (default 3)
  --max-rows <n>    Refuse a figure above this many rows (default 60)
  --style <s>       auto (default), none, ansi or css. A figure's
                    marks carry their meaning -- a direct cell, a
                    closure cell, an upward edge -- and each profile
                    has one way to show it: SGR escapes for text, CSS
                    classes for svg. auto picks that mechanism where
                    the destination can carry it: escapes only on a
                    terminal (NO_COLOR is honoured), and an svg keeps
                    the stylesheet that makes it standalone. none
                    drops both; on svg the classes stay and only the
                    stylesheet goes, for a host page that has already
                    bound --av-ink and its kin. Escapes are never
                    written to a file
  --format <f>      text (default) or json, the whole report
  --relation <n>    tree, matrix, layer: draw over this relation only;
                    graph: keep this predicate (repeatable)
  --root <path>     tree: draw only the subtree under this node;
                    repeatable
  --order <o>       matrix: canon (default) or partition
  --closure         matrix: mark transitively reachable cells +
  --group-by <k>    graph: one subgraph per distinct value of field k;
                    layer: one band per value (required)
  --layers <a,b>    layer: the bands in this order, top first; without
                    it the order is derived from the relation
  --edges <e>       layer: which of the relation's edges to draw over
                    the bands -- upward (the violations, the default
                    for text and svg), all (mermaid's default) or none
  --label <k>       graph: label each node with field k
  --sets <path>     sets: the map whose keys are the sets
  --member <k>      sets: the field holding each set's members
  --universe <p>    sets: the full element domain, so the empty
                    column exists
  --min-degree <n>  sets: drop intersections below this degree
  --min-size <n>    layers: drop intersections below this many paths
  --max-cols <n>    sets, layers: elide columns beyond this many
  --profile <p>     poset: values | defaults (default) | gen

View exit codes: 0 rendered, 1 --check mismatch or lossy under
--strict, 2 usage or --max-rows exceeded, 4 the document does not stand
up on its own, or a relation, root or path that names nothing.

Render options:
  --at <path>       Render the value at this path ($.a.b); the root by
                    default
  --profile <file>  A profile document, profile: {lang, ...}, vetted
                    against aontu:profile; repeatable, one per language
  --unit <path>     Render only the unit with this path
  --stdout          One unit's bytes and nothing else (with --unit when
                    the instance has several)
  --out <dir>       Write every unit below dir, or nothing; never deletes
  --check <dir>     Compare every unit with dir/<path>; drift is listed
  --coverage        Report what the render read and what it did not:
                    model paths no output consumed, and rendered
                    declarations no rule produced. Writes nothing
  --coverage-at <p> Measure coverage under this path only, instead of
                    the document root
  --strict          Refuse the opaque escapes (a text declaration, a raw
                    block)
  --format <f>      text (default) or json, the whole report; json
                    carries the dispatch trace, one entry per emitted
                    piece

Render exit codes: 0 rendered, 1 lossy under --strict or drift under
--check, 2 usage or I/O (a refused unit path included), 4 the document
does not stand up or the instance is not aontu:code.

A render entry file whose extension is not .aon is a TEMPLATE: a
generator in the target's own syntax, whose marker lines carry aontu
and whose other lines are output. It is desugared before it is
evaluated, and --marker names the marker for a language the table does
not know.

Template options:
  --resugar       The file is the canonical aontu; print the template
                  form instead of reading one
  --check         Desugar and resugar, and exit 1 if the file is not
                  what the round trip answers
  --marker <t>    The marker, when the extension does not name it
                  (default //-, and #- --- /*- by extension)

The template verb prints the canonical aontu form of a generator
written in the target's own syntax: a marked line is aontu source, and
every other line is a line of output.

Template exit codes: 0 written, 1 --check drift, 2 usage or I/O.

Set options:
  --entry <file>    The document the change is checked against
  --overlay <file>  The file the change is appended to (created if
                    absent; not written when the change does not hold)
  --in-place        Rewrite a pinned literal where it was written,
                    instead of appending a line that contradicts it.
                    The span is verified against the source text
                    before writing, and where the value is not a
                    single editable literal in this overlay the
                    assignment is appended as usual with a warning
                    saying why
  --dry-run         Print the overlay that would be written, write
                    nothing
  --format <f>      text (default) or json

Set exit codes are vet's verdict classes: 0 valid, 1 invalid (the
change contradicts a pinned value -- aontu why locates it, and
--in-place rewrites it), 2 usage, 3 incomplete, 4 the entry does not
stand up on its own.

Agentsmd options:
  --write <file>  Splice the stanza into this file between the
                  aontu:begin and aontu:end markers, appending them
                  when they are absent; the rest is left alone

Agentsmd exit codes: 0 generated, 2 usage, 4 the document does not
stand up on its own.

Fmt options:
  -w, --write     Rewrite each file in place, when its form would change
  -l, --list      Print the name of each file whose form would change
  --check         Like --list, and exit 1 when any would: the CI gate
  -d, --diff      Print a unified diff for each file whose form would
                  change
  --lint          Report the style findings, key case and repeated
                  shapes, on standard error, and print nothing else
  --strict        With --lint, and exit 1 when there is a finding

The fmt verb prints one document in the agreed form; with no file it
reads standard input. Several files need one of the options above.

Fmt exit codes: 0 formatted or clean, 1 a --check file would change or
a --strict finding, 2 usage, 4 a document does not parse.

The lsp verb runs the language server over standard input and output
(LSP: JSON-RPC with Content-Length framing) until the client exits;
editors launch it with no arguments. The standalone aontu-lsp binary
runs the same server.

The mcp verb runs the Model Context Protocol server over standard
input and output (newline-delimited JSON-RPC), confined below --root
when one is given. It is part of the npm build, as the standalone
aontu-mcp binary is.
