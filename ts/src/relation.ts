// RELATION GRAPH CHECKS (G4 phase 5,
// docs/capability-review/g4-identity-relations.md): acyclicity and
// inverse consistency over the edge set, checked AFTER unification and
// never by it.
//
// Why not in the lattice. Both properties are GLOBAL and NON-MONOTONE:
// an acyclic graph becomes cyclic when one more edge unifies in, and an
// inverse that is present becomes absent when the far side is narrowed.
// The lattice guarantee is that more information never falsifies what
// has been observed, so a constraint that could be true and then false
// is not a constraint the lattice may hold. These are facts about the
// finished model, and the verb that reports facts about a finished
// model is where they belong.
//
// A relation is DECLARED as data, under the `relations` key of the
// document root, which is the `std/system` vocabulary's convention:
//
//   relations: dependsOn: $.std.Relation & {
//     target: $.std.Service, inverse: dependedOnBy, acyclic: true
//   }
//
// Nothing in the engine knows the name `relations`; this pass does,
// and says so.
