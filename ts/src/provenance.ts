// THE PROVENANCE RECORDER (G7 phase 3,
// docs/capability-review/g7-machine-access.md): what CONTRIBUTED to
// the value at a path, in order, with the site each contribution was
// written at. `why` is the positive twin of G2's error report — errors
// explain what failed to unify, this explains what did.
//
// The recorder rides the CONTEXT and is off by default: `unite` pays
// one property load on the normal path, and an instrumented run pays
// site materialisation knowingly. It records at `unite` and nowhere
// else, because that is the one place every meet passes through — the
// same reason G3's deprecation rider lives there. A meet is where
// information currently vanishes, so a meet is what to record.
//
// Contributions are the operands that were NOT produced by an earlier
// meet at the same path: a value that a previous meet made is an
// intermediate, not a source. Deduplicated by (path, val id) — ids are
// unique per run — so fixpoint revisits across up to `maxcc` passes do
// not multiply the record.
//
// Roles come from the operand itself, with no further instrumentation:
// a reference is still a RefVal when it meets its peer (its canon is
// the path it names), a preference is still a PrefVal (its canon is
// the `*` form), and a spread-applied template is marked once where
// the spread is applied. Precedence is spread > ref > pref > literal:
// a preference INSIDE a spread template is a spread contribution,
// which is what the author needs to be told.
