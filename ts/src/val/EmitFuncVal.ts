// TRANSFORMATION: `emit(select, table)` (G9 phase 6,
// docs/design/EMIT.0.md). Apply-templates, with the dispatch in the
// engine and none of it in user space.
//
//   emit($.services, [
//     {match: {kind: sqs}, body: [`listen(` + .pin + `)`]}
//     {match: {kind: http}, body: [`serve(` + .path + `)`]}
//   ])
//
// For every node of `select`, in order, the first template whose
// `match` the node unifies with is taken and its `body` instantiated
// AGAINST THAT NODE. The result is one flat list.
//
// WHY THIS CANNOT BE WRITTEN IN THE DOCUMENT (EMIT.0.md, "What it
// takes"). A rule table held as a value cannot be dispatched against:
// a body referenced by path resolves its relative references AT THE
// DEFINITION SITE, and the positional resolution that does exist is a
// dot COUNT that does not survive being consumed by a second dispatch.
// The builtin instantiates a body at the node it matched -- a NAMED
// origin -- which is the whole capability.
//
// THE BODY'S RELATIVE REFERENCES ARE BOUND TO THE NODE. `.pin` inside
// a body is the matched node's `pin`, and `_` is the node itself, as
// it is in every other generator. The binding is done HERE rather than
// left to path resolution: a relative path is a COUNT taken wherever
// the value comes to rest, and the nodes of a computed selection
// (`filter(...)`) come to rest nowhere -- there is no position for a
// count to be taken from. An ABSOLUTE reference is untouched and still
// reads the document root.
//
// The binding stops at a nested generator's own binding argument
// (boundArgStart): a rule table nested in a body is the INNER emit's
// to bind, so `.x` inside it is the inner node. What crosses the
// boundary is the nested call's SELECTOR, which is argument 0 and is
// bound here -- the selector is the channel.
//
// THE RESULT IS FLAT, and that is a constraint rather than a
// convenience: the fragment algebra is flat because the nested
// spelling refuses even a valid instance in both ports, so a dispatch
// returning a tree would undo that ruling. A body element that is
// itself a list SPLICES, which is what makes a nested emit compose.
//
// NO MATCH IS AN ERROR (`emit_none`). XSLT's built-in rule copies an
// unhandled node's string value into the result, which for code output
// means model data landing silently in the middle of a source file.
// That is the single worst default in the prior art and it is refused.
// An EMPTY selection, by contrast, emits nothing -- which is the whole
// conditional mechanism, and why no `when` directive exists.
//
// A NAMED TABLE IS A PLACEHELD `emit` (`%wire = emit(_, T)`). A table
// written at a document position is DRIVEN there, so its bodies'
// relative references resolve against wherever it sits and miss;
// nothing in the language holds a value unevaluated at such a
// position, and what does hold one is a CALL's template argument.
// `emit(.listen, %wire)` follows the reference and reads the table out
// of the placeheld call; `.listen & %wire` fills the hole. Both are
// the same dispatch, and it is what lets a rule set name ITSELF.
//
// TERMINATION IS THE SELECTION'S. Unlike `pack` and `each`, this one
// recurses -- a nested model walked into nested output is the
// capability the rule layer exists to add -- so the bound is not "it
// cannot call itself" but "each dispatch descends into a finite bag
// that already exists, and a selection that empties emits nothing". A
// rule set that walks into itself WITHOUT descending is charged to the
// depth budget and refused as `unify_cycle`, like any other runaway
// descent.
