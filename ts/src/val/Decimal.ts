/*
 * The exact base-10 decimal value behind the `bigdecimal` leaf, and the
 * parser for the `0d` literal family that reaches both exact leaves.
 *
 * A Decimal is a coefficient and a scale:
 *
 *   value = unscaled / 10^scale
 *
 * with `unscaled` a native bigint and `scale` a plain integer. Every
 * operation here is EXACT: aontu's whole numeric operator surface
 * (`+`, `upper()`, `lower()`, unary minus) is exact, so no rounding
 * context, precision or rounding mode exists anywhere in this file --
 * addition aligns scales and adds coefficients, and ceiling/floor is
 * coefficient arithmetic that never lets a float64 near the value.
 * Where an exact answer will not fit the budget the answer is refused,
 * never rounded (see decimalOverBudget).
 *
 * D4 -- ONE VALUE, ONE RENDERING. In a unifier canon must be a function
 * of the value, so scale is presentation and not identity: `0d0.10`,
 * `0d0.1` and `0d1e-1` are the same lattice point and must render
 * identically. A Decimal therefore NORMALISES IN ITS CONSTRUCTOR --
 * every Decimal in existence is in minimal form, which is what makes
 * `equals` a two-field comparison and `same()` correct without any
 * pointer identity (D2).
 *
 * The minimal form keeps ONE decimal place at the bottom. `0d` names the
 * numeric FAMILY, not the leaf, so an integral bigdecimal that rendered
 * as `0d1000` would reparse as a biginteger -- a kind-flipping canon of
 * exactly the sort R4's `.0` suffix exists to prevent. So `0d1e3` canons
 * as `0d1000.0`, and scale is never reduced below 1.
 *
 * Go mirror (D8): a struct of (coeff *big.Int, scale int32) normalised
 * by the same rule -- strip trailing zeros while scale > 1, then raise
 * the scale to 1 when it is lower, zero always at scale 1.
