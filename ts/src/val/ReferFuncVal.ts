// CHECKED, TYPED, LINK-SHAPED REFERENCES (G4 phase 2,
// docs/capability-review/g4-identity-relations.md): `refer(t)` is a
// constraint on a string-valued field. The string must be an ENTITY
// ADDRESS, the addressed node must exist in the evaluation, and — when
// `t` is given — `t` is unified INTO the target. The field's own value
// stays the address string: a LINK, not an embedding.
//
// This is the piece a plain reference cannot be. `$.a.b` resolves by
// CLONING its target into place, so `dependsOn: [$.services.auth]`
// generates a full copy of the auth node where the author meant a
// name. `refer` leaves the name and checks it.
//
// Constraint FLOW rather than a check: `refer(t)` does not merely test
// the target against `t`, it unifies `t` into it. Referring to
// something as a Service MAKES it one, and if it cannot be, the
// conflict is an ordinary located error. Check-only semantics would be
// non-monotone — true, then false as the target grows — and the
// lattice guarantee is that more information never falsifies what has
// been observed.
