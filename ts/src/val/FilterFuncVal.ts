// GENERATION: `filter(data, cond)` (G8 phase 2,
// docs/capability-review/g8-generation.md). The children of `data`
// that unify with `cond`, keys preserved for a map and order for a
// list; the children that do not are DROPPED, not refused.
//
//   debugged: filter($.services, {debug: true})
//   sidecars: pack($.debugged, {image: "acme/debug:1.0"})
//
// A CHILD IS KEPT WHEN THE CONDITION CHANGES NOTHING: the meet
// succeeds AND its answer is the child itself, which is to say the
// child ALREADY satisfies the condition. Mere unifiability is not the
// test, and cannot be: a map is open, so `{p:2}` unifies with
// `{debug:true}` perfectly well by GAINING the key -- and a filter
// that keeps everything that could be made to match keeps everything.
// The design named unifiability; its own example
// (`filter($.services, {debug:true})`) is unsatisfiable under it.
//
// There is no predicate language here and there will not be one:
// `cond` is an ordinary Aontu value, so the constraint atoms compose
// with it for free (`filter($.deploy, {replicas: min(3)})`), and a
// document that can filter can be read by anything that can read a
// document.
//
// A FAILED CHILD IS AN ANSWER, not an error. The meet runs in TRIAL
// MODE -- the mechanism disjunction already uses to try each member
// against a peer (trialUnify in FuncBaseVal) -- so a child that does
// not match costs nothing and reports nothing.
//
// TOTALITY. `filter` iterates a finite, settled bag and cannot call
// itself, exactly as `pack` and `each` cannot.
