// GENERATION: `pack(data, tmpl)` (G8 phase 1,
// docs/capability-review/g8-generation.md). One child of the result map
// per child of `data`, each of them `tmpl` cloned at the destination.
//
//   names: [web, auth, billing]
//   deploy: pack($.names, {
//     image: "acme/" + key() + ":1.4.2"
//     replicas: *2 | integer
//   })
//
// WHY A FUNCTION AND NOT SYNTAX. A comprehension would need keywords,
// a scoping rule, and string interpolation for the computed name; the
// language already has functions, spread templates, and `key()`, and
// `pack` is those three composed. A call is also DATA -- a named node
// in the tree -- so a document that generates stays as analysable as
// one that does not.
//
// KEYS ARE DATA, NOT POSITION. For a list, the strings themselves are
// the keys (a non-string element is refused: `pack_key`); for a map,
// its keys. Terraform's `count` keyed by index is the counter-example
// the review names: reordering the data churns every downstream child.
// Duplicate keys are not an error -- the colliding children unify,
// exactly as duplicate source keys already merge.
//
// TOTALITY. `pack` iterates a finite, settled bag and cannot call
// itself: the number of children it can produce is fixed by data that
// already exists. Nothing here can recurse, which is the guarantee the
// combinators exist to keep.
