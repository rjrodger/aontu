// MODULE IDENTITY AND LOCAL RESOLUTION (G6 phase 2,
// docs/capability-review/g6-distribution.md).
//
// An import is still just `@"…"`; the string's SHAPE routes it, so the
// grammar is untouched and every existing include keeps its exact
// behaviour:
//
//   service: @"corp.example/schemas/service@1"
//   frozen:  @"corp.example/schemas/service@1#aon1-4vJemVYtWFR2mQeN…"
//   local:   @"./fragment.aon"        <- unchanged, not a module
//
// EVALUATION NEVER TOUCHES THE NETWORK. Resolution reads local stores
// only: `aon_vendor/` beside the project's `mod.aon`, then a
// content-addressed user cache keyed by canon-hash. Fetching is a
// separate, explicit tool step, and a module that is in neither store
// is an evaluation error that says so.
//
// TWO PINS, TWO ROLES. The lockfile's `oci` digest certifies that these
// are the bytes the registry served; the `canon` hash certifies that
// this is the MEANING that was reviewed. Only the second can be checked
// locally without the registry, and it is the one this file checks: the
// module is unified standalone and its canon-hash compared with the
// pin. An inline `#aon1-…` fragment is the same check without a
// lockfile — the degenerate mode for single-file and agent-sandbox use.
