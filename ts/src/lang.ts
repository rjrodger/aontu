// INCLUDE_KINDS IS THE RULE FOR WHAT AN INCLUDE MEANS (ADR-012,
// use-cases/BUGS.md §49). An extension is on this list or it is not
// read at all, and its entry says WHICH OF TWO THINGS the file is.
//
// `source` — Aontu, with everything the language has: types, defaults,
// references, constraints, its own includes. Two extensions, and they
// are the ones this project owns.
//
// `text` — the file's BYTES, as one string scalar. No parser is
// chosen, so there is nothing for two ports to disagree about and
// nothing in the file that can mean anything: `notes: @"notes.txt"`
// is a document loading prose into a string. `.txt` is the only
// extension here by default; `AontuOptions.textExt` (the CLI's
// `--text-ext`) adds others, because which name a project keeps its
// templates under is the project's business, not this table's.
//
// A FORMAT NAME — configuration DATA, parsed by that format's own
// parser into the JSON value it denotes, which then becomes Aontu
// values like any other data. Every one of these formats maps onto
// JSON, which is why one word covers them: a `.toml` file is a map of
// scalars, lists and maps, and so is the `.aon` file that unifies with
// it. What the format does NOT get is the language — a `&` in a YAML
// file is a YAML anchor, not a spread key, because the YAML parser
// reads it, not this one.
//
// The parsers are @tabnas's, one per format, and the Go port uses the
// same ones (ADR-001): the two implementations agree because they are
// running the same grammar, not because two hand-written readers were
// kept in step.

// ConstraintVal.ts, deliberately before the settled check), which is
