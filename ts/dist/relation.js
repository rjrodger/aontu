// RELATION GRAPH VERDICTS (RELATIONS.0.md §3.3, replacing the G4
// phase 5 magic-key pass): acyclicity and inverse consistency over
// the edge set, DECLARED by the graph atoms -- `acyclic()` and
// `inverse(name)` conjoined at the field whose key is the predicate
// -- and decided AFTER unification, never by it.
//
// Why not in the lattice. Both properties are GLOBAL and NON-MONOTONE:
// an acyclic graph becomes cyclic when one more edge unifies in, and an
// inverse that is present becomes absent when the far side is narrowed.
// The lattice guarantee is that more information never falsifies what
// has been observed, so a constraint that could be true and then false
// is not a constraint the lattice may hold. These are facts about the
// finished model, so the atoms only REGISTER during unification
// (GraphAtomVal.register, onto ctx._reldecls), and the verdict lands
// at GENERATION -- the sizing atoms' model -- where no more
// information can arrive. The `relations` verb reports the same
// verdict from the same declarations: one decision, two surfaces.
//
// The old declaration channel -- a `relations:` key at the document
// root, read by name -- is GONE, discharging ADR-010's grandfather
// clause: the engine no longer knows any spellable key. The target
// half of the old declaration is `rel(t)`'s flow at the site, which
// checks by unifying rather than by a report-layer probe.
