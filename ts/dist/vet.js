    // that fails inside a REFERENCED map is recorded twice: once at the
    // key that actually conflicts, and once at the enclosing map, which
    // collapsed as a consequence and carries the child's two sites. Both
    // are the same cause; only the deeper one names the field an author
    // or an agent has to edit, and `$.q` for a conflict in `$.q.a` sent a
    // repair loop to rewrite the whole record -- twice over, identically,
    // when two of its fields conflicted. Depth first, then the sort order
    // above, so the choice stays deterministic in both ports.
