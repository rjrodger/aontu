// The evaluation budgets live on the context (ctx.budget: passes,
// revisits, depth), defaulted there to the shared spec-visible
// constants test/spec/budget.tsv pins in both ports (9 / 999 / 1000)
// and configurable through the trust profile (G5, docs/trust.md) —
// deterministically: a budget is an integer count of engine events,
// never wall-clock.
//
// Why the revisit default is 999: how many times one (Val, path) pair
// may be re-unified within a single fixpoint pass before the evaluator
// calls it non-convergence (`unify_cycle`). The old false positive here
// -- a legal model with many sibling conjunct terms at one path, each
// re-running the TOP self-unify -- is fixed by the per-pass memo below
// (_tcc/_tpi); test/spec/budget.tsv drives 1200 sibling terms through
// both engines as the regression guard.
//
// Why the depth default is 1000: the whole shared suite peaks at 603
// (the deliberately extreme 1200-sibling-term fixture; ordinary
// documents are two orders below), and V8 exhausts its call stack
// somewhere past depth ~1500 in this evaluator. 1000 sits above every
// real document and below the host limit, so the budget -- not the
// host -- decides the verdict.
// Charge a DIRECT `Val.unify` recursion to the same depth budget that
// `unite` enforces. Function and operator arguments evaluate through
// `arg.unify(top(), ...)` rather than through the dispatcher, so without
// this the counter stays flat while the JavaScript stack keeps growing:
// a 1500-deep `upper(upper(...))` resolved in TypeScript while Go — which
// routes its arguments through the counted dispatcher — reported
// `unify_cycle`. Returns the budget nil instead of running when the
