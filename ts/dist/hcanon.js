// The HASH FORM (G6 phase 0, docs/capability-review/g6-distribution.md):
// exactly the unify-level canon with the additions that close its
// semantic gaps, so that two documents with the same hash form have the
// same meaning:
//
//   - a CLOSED map or list renders wrapped: close({...}), close([...])
//     (canon drops closedness);
//   - the type/hide MARKS render as their builtin wrappers: type(x),
//     hide(x) (canon drops marks).
//
// Both additions reuse existing parseable syntax, so the hash form
// remains valid Aontu source and round-trips:
// hcanon(unify(parse(hcanon(v)))) == hcanon(v) is a spec-suite property
// (test/spec/hcanon.tsv). User-facing canon is UNCHANGED — hcanon is a
// separate rendering.
//
// An ALIAS REFERENCE left standing in a spread template renders its
// EXPANSION through this same walk rather than through the reference's
// own canon, so a close() or a mark on the aliased value survives into
// the hash. Without that the wrappers above are absent exactly where
// the alias filter has already erased the declaration that carried
// them (BUGS.md §60).
//
// The marks PROPAGATE to every descendant at unification (walkMark), so
// a wrapper is emitted only where a mark STARTS: the walk carries the
// inherited marks down and a child whose mark the parent already
// carries renders bare. Without that, hide({a:1}) would render every
// leaf re-wrapped — still correct, never minimal, and not what the
// source said.
//
// canonHash (G6 phase 1) is the pin built on it:
//   "aon1-" + base64url( SHA-256( UTF-8( hcanon(v) ) ) )
// (unpadded base64url, RFC 4648 section 5). The "aon1-" scheme id
// exists so a future semantically-stronger normal form is an upgrade,
// not a breakage. This is a CANONICAL-TEXT hash, not a semantic
// equivalence class: the failure direction is the safe one — a false
// "changed" forces a needless re-review; a false "unchanged" would need
// two hash forms with the same bytes and different meanings, which is
// exactly the gap the close/mark wrappers exist to shut.
