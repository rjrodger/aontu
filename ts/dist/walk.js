// One tree walk, two consumers: the language server collects NilVals
// for diagnostics (ts/src/lsp.ts) and the validation verb both stamps
// provenance and collects NilVals for findings (ts/src/vet.ts). They had
// the same traversal written out twice, which is one copy too many for
// something with three easy ways to be subtly wrong:
//
//   - a Val's children live under `peg`, which is an ARRAY for lists,
//     conjuncts and disjuncts, and an OBJECT for maps;
//   - a spread constraint lives OFF-peg (`spread.cj`), so a value inside
//     a `&:` template is reachable only by following it deliberately;
//   - the `seen` set is a termination guard, not an optimisation, and
//     the non-Val guard is load-bearing too: a peg object can hold
//     entries that are not Vals.
//
// The visitor returns false to prune the subtree below a node, which is
// how a nil collector stops at the nil rather than walking into the
// operands it carries.
