# Use cases

Documentation examples are small on purpose. Systems are not. The
eighteen models in [`use-cases/`](../use-cases/) close that gap: each
one is an enterprise-shaped system built as real aontu documents (a
service catalog, a schema registry, an RBAC model) and each carries a
`check.sh` that drives the actual CLI and asserts every outcome, with
golden diffs for expected output and error-code greps for expected
refusals. When a page in these docs shows a shape, this is where that
shape lives, running. Run one case, or the whole suite:

<!-- test: skip runs the full case suite; use-cases/run-all.sh is its own gate, run before every landing -->
```sh
$ ./use-cases/03-api-contract/check.sh   # one case
$ ./use-cases/run-all.sh                 # all eighteen, one verdict line per case
```

The scripts need Node with `ts/node_modules` installed, plus `python3`
and `git` for a few cases. Each case's `README.md` is the worked
example in full, with verbatim CLI output; the sections below compress
it.

## 01. Service catalog

A Backstage-style catalog for eight services across three teams, where
the org chart and the runtime each hold facts about the same things.
`catalog.aon` says what each service *is* (owner, tier, dependencies);
`deploy.aon` says what each cluster *runs* (image, replicas, ports);
and the deployment view references the catalog, so one evaluation
merges them field by field and any contradiction between the views is a
located error instead of a silent fork. The case also drives `refer()`
existence checks, declared relations, and change requests written as
four-line overlay files. The same service, seen from both views:

```aon
# catalog.aon — the catalog view
services: payments: {
  tier: 1
  description: "Card payment orchestration and capture API."
  dependsOn: [
    "$.services.ledger"
    "$.services.risk"
    "$.services.auth"
    "$.services.notify"
  ]
  dependedOnBy: ["$.services.gateway"]
}

# deploy.aon — the deployment view
deploy: eu1: payments: $.services.payments & {
  image: "registry.acme.internal/payments:2.14.1"
  replicas: 6
  ports: http: { number:8080 protocol:http }
}
```

The reference joins them, and an overlay claiming `tier: 2` refuses
with `[aontu/scalar_value]`. The live model, refusals included:
[`use-cases/01-service-catalog/`](../use-cases/01-service-catalog/).

## 02. Deploy config

Four services, three environments, four layers of authority: org
policy, team defaults, a service catalog, per-environment overlays.
This is Helm-values and Kustomize territory, and the layering
mechanism is the preference-rank ladder: the fewer stars, the stronger
the default. The org writes `***`, teams
`**`, environments `*`, a concrete pin beats them all, and two
disagreeing defaults at the same rank are a conflict. The whole
ladder, trimmed from the case's `probes/rank-ladder.aon`:

```aontu
org_team_env: ***info|string
org_team_env: **debug|string
org_team_env: *warn|string

pinned: ***info|string
pinned: **debug|string
pinned: error
```
```json
{
  "org_team_env": "warn",
  "pinned": "error"
}
```

Statement order never matters, and `aontu why` prints each surviving
rung with the file and line that wrote it. The full six-file layering:
[`use-cases/02-deploy-config/`](../use-cases/02-deploy-config/).

## 03. API contract

A REST contract for a project-management SaaS: entities, endpoints,
request bodies keyed by status code, one error envelope. It is the
document an agent codes against and is corrected by: the agent emits
a candidate body, `aontu vet` reports what fails and where, and the
case's `repair.py` repairs it mechanically from the `--format json`
findings. Exit codes are verdict classes (0 valid, 1 invalid, 3
incomplete, 4 schema-side error), so a caller can branch before
reading a byte. A wire message is a `close()`d shape, so a surplus or
typo'd key is a conflict, not a silently ignored extra:

```aon
CreateUserRequest: close({
  email: $.types.Email
  name: $.types.DisplayName
  role: $.types.Role
  # Invitations send an email unless explicitly suppressed.
  send_invite?: boolean
})
```

`vet --at '$.msg.CreateUserRequest'` anchors on it directly. The
contract, the candidates, and the repair loop:
[`use-cases/03-api-contract/`](../use-cases/03-api-contract/).

## 04. Schema evolution

A shared customer-profile schema across three released versions, with
a queue of proposed changes. `aontu breaking --against` is the
governance gate a schema registry needs: additive changes pass, a
narrowed constraint or an added required key exits 1 with a witness
naming both files, and a `must()` on the new side answers *undecided*
(exit 3) rather than guessing. The centrepiece is the two-release
rename: deprecate in v2, remove in v3. The v2 mark, from
`profile-v2.aon`:

```aon
phone?: deprecate(string, {
  msg: "free-form phone is unvalidated; write E.164 to contact.phone"
  use: "$.profile.contact.phone"
  since: "2.0.0"
})
```

The mark rides the value: `vet` warns with the data site when an
instance still uses the field, and `--allow-deprecated-removal` admits
the v3 deletion while keeping the finding visible at severity
`warning`. All three versions and the proposal queue:
[`use-cases/04-schema-evolution/`](../use-cases/04-schema-evolution/).

## 05. RBAC policy

An authorization model for a multi-tenant SaaS, written as data the
engine checks: a permission catalog, an exhaustive role registry,
tenant plans, and agent-emitted candidates vetted against all of it. Every grant is a `refer()`-checked address, so a
hallucinated permission is a located refusal, and the registry is
`close()`d, so an invented role dies at review. The security rule "no
role holds the wildcard unless flagged privileged" is structural: a
role is a disjunction of two closed shapes:

```aon
Role: type(
  close({
    desc: string
    rank: integer & min(0) & max(100)
    tenantOwner: boolean
    privileged: true
    grants: unique() & [&: refer() & string]
  })
  | close({
    desc: string
    rank: integer & min(0) & max(100)
    tenantOwner: false
    privileged: false
    grants: unique() & [&: refer() & string & neq("$.permissions.admin_all")]
  })
)
```

The unprivileged branch excludes the wildcard from every grant with one
`neq()`, so a proposal granting it to a collaborator role is refused. A
grant is a **tree address**, which is what makes `refer()` a checked
foreign key against the permission catalog rather than a string
comparison. The registry and its attack proposals:
[`use-cases/05-rbac-policy/`](../use-cases/05-rbac-policy/).

## 06. Kubernetes golden path

A platform team's golden path: product teams edit a 40-line service
model, and evaluating `main.aon` renders three Deployments and three
Services, around 340 lines of manifests, none written by hand. An
override composes like plain data (pin `replicas: 6` at the generated
path and the sibling defaults survive), `close()` seals the service
set against drift, and `vet` runs the org guardrails over the rendered
JSON. `pack()` makes a manifest per service, and a second pack merges
one authored column into every generated child:

```aon
deploy: close(pack($.svc.names, {
  apiVersion: "apps/v1"
  kind: Deployment
  metadata: name: key(2) # depth-counted by hand
  # ... the rest of the Deployment skeleton ...
}))

deploy: pack($.svc.version, {
  spec: template: spec: containers: [
    image: $.platform.registry + "/" + key(6) + ":" + _
  ]
})
```

The version column becomes the image tag through `_`, and drift in
either direction refuses: an entry with no service hits the sealed
set, a service with no entry leaves `image: string` ungenerable. The
whole generator: [`use-cases/06-k8s-golden-path/`](../use-cases/06-k8s-golden-path/).

## 07. Event contracts

An order service's events, held the way a Kafka schema registry holds
them: one shared CloudEvents-flavoured envelope, one closed payload
shape per event type, a discriminated union, and a compatibility gate
between contract versions. Producers vet before
publishing, consumers vet a whole stream sample with one command, and
CI refuses a revision that breaks subscribers. Each event type is the
envelope, narrowed by conjunction and sealed:

```aon
OrderPaid: close($.Envelope & {
  type: "order.paid"
  payload: close({
    order_id: re("^ord-[0-9a-f]{8}$")
    payment_ref: re("^psp-[a-z0-9-]{4,40}$")
    amount_cents: integer & min(1)
    method: "card"|"sepa"|"paypal"|"invoice"
  })
})
```

Pinning `type` to one string is what makes the union discriminated,
and `close()` keeps surplus keys off the wire. The contract versions
and the stream samples:
[`use-cases/07-event-contracts/`](../use-cases/07-event-contracts/).

## 08. Feature flags

The write-path case: a flag catalog with environment and tenant
overrides, mutated by `aontu set` into an overlay file the reviewed base
files never absorb. Ten sets of the same path collapse to a single
overlay line under `--in-place`, `why` attributes the served value to
the overlay with rank annotations, and a hostile overlay is confined by
`--trust`. The kill switch is a concrete pin in the catalog, so no
overlay of any rank can flip it: `set` vets before writing and refuses
with the pinning site named:

```
$ aontu set '$.flags.payments_legacy_gateway.enabled=true' --entry base.aon --overlay overlay.aon
verdict: invalid

$.flags.payments_legacy_gateway.enabled: scalar_value [conflict]
  [aontu/scalar_value]: Cannot unify values at path $.flags.payments_legacy_gateway.enabled
  data: overlay.aon:2:48 (true)
  schema: base.aon:53:14 (false)
```

Exit 1, and the overlay is untouched (the case asserts both). The full
write loop: [`use-cases/08-feature-flags/`](../use-cases/08-feature-flags/).

## 09. Agent tools

An agent platform's tool registry: six tools with closed argument
schemas, rate limits, and side-effect classes, plus a runtime
guardrail that vets each `{tool, arguments}` call at `$.guard.<tool>`.
The four vet verdicts are a dispatcher's decision table (valid:
dispatch; invalid: refuse, feed the findings back; incomplete: ask for
the missing argument; error: unknown tool), and the case drives the
real `aontu mcp` server over JSON-RPC too. The wire
schema is generated from the registry, so the two can never drift:

<!-- test: skip a fragment of 09-agent-tools, whose `registry.aon` this page does not ship; the case's own check.sh runs it -->
```aon
@"registry.aon"

guard: pack($.argschemas, close({ tool:key() arguments:_ }))
```

`close()` survives the `_` clone, so a hallucinated argument on any
tool is a located `[aontu/closed]`. The registry, the calls, and the
MCP session: [`use-cases/09-agent-tools/`](../use-cases/09-agent-tools/).

## 10. Data model

An order-to-cash domain: customers with 64-bit upstream ledger ids,
orders, invoices, money. One document is at once the vet schema, the
referential-integrity checker, and the seed-data generator; money is
the stress test the `0d` exact-decimal literals exist for. The price
book pins its own sums, so an engine that computed them inexactly
could not produce output at all.

<!-- test: scenario exact-money -->

The smallest such theorem, lifted from the case's `seed.aon`: write
it as `reconcile.aon`:

<!-- test: file reconcile.aon -->
```aontu
reconcile: centsPath: (10 + 20) & 30 # integer cents: exact
reconcile: exactPath: (0d0.1 + 0d0.2) & 0d0.3 # exact decimals: also exact
```

Evaluate it:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu reconcile.aon
{
  "reconcile": {
    "centsPath": 30,
    "exactPath": 0.3
  }
}
```

Binary64 arithmetic answers `0.30000000000000004` here; the pinned
`& 0d0.3` holds because `0d` values are exact, and the case's
`money-wire.aon` shows how that exactness crosses JSON. The same
schema is a code source: the case's `xf-domain.aon` walks its record
types into `aontu:code` records, and `aontu render` lowers them to one
exported interface per record under the bundled TypeScript profile;
`xf-order.aon` renders the same walk as TypeScript and as Go, where
the profile spells `ledgerId` as `LedgerID` and an optional field as a
pointer with `omitempty`. Both are held by `render --check`. The
domain, the transforms and the failed attempts, kept executable:
[`use-cases/10-data-model/`](../use-cases/10-data-model/).

## 11. Shared modules

The distribution story: a platform team's deployment contract,
vendored into a consumer repo and held by `mod tidy` / `verify` /
`vendor` / `manifest`, a one-line lockfile, and canon-hash integrity
pins. The pin survives a byte-different, meaning-identical module
refactor (a byte-hash lockfile breaks on exactly this), and a flipped
default in the vendored tree fails evaluation with both hashes named. A single file can freeze the hash in the import string, with no
`mod.aon` and no lockfile: the agent-sandbox mode:

<!-- test: skip a fragment of 11-shared-modules, which resolves against that case's module store; the case's own check.sh runs it -->
```aon
svc: @"corp.example/schemas/service@1#aon1-zFHnyVa1fA--g8hTx8lUUhaKzzRUNI--2nDheIMsSFs"
svc: spec: { name:"audit-log" owner:"sec-ops@corp.example" }
```

A tampered store is refused, with both hashes named:

```
module integrity: corp.example/schemas/service@1 expected aon1-zFHnyVa1fA--g8hTx8lUUhaKzzRUNI--2nDheIMsSFs got aon1-NHmNT6r-Lhy8di9BgGNRfgwNFT3r5PgCZxCYnJ4F0Ws
```

The `#aon1-` pin resolves, verifies, and refuses a mangled hash with
the same integrity error. The publish gate and the whole vendoring
flow: [`use-cases/11-shared-modules/`](../use-cases/11-shared-modules/).

## 12. Relations

An ETL pipeline DAG: four jobs, one relation (`feeds`, with its
written-out inverse `fedBy`). The whole thing is declared once, at the
field, and data documents stay plain JSON-shaped string lists, with no
per-link boilerplate. A cycle or a missing
inverse refuses at generation with a located finding naming the loop
or the exact absent entry, and `aontu reaches --relation feeds`
answers the closure question directionally over the same edges. The
declaration, from the case's `spec.aon`:

```aon
feeds?: rel($.spec.JobShape) & acyclic() & inverse(fedBy)
fedBy?: rel($.spec.JobShape)
```

`rel(t)` makes the field's strings checked entity addresses and flows
the shape into every target, `re()` rides onto every address, and the
graph atoms are decided at generation, where every edge is known. The
DAG, its refusals, and the append proposal:
[`use-cases/12-relations/`](../use-cases/12-relations/).

## 13. Recursive schema

An approval chain: a `Step` is an approver, a decision, and optionally
the step that follows it. Writing `then?: $.spec.Step` inside `Step`
means the fixpoint, with no marker and no unrolled copies: the schema
applies at every depth, expanding one level per [meet](unification.md)
with concrete data, so `vet` descends exactly as far as the data does.
Canon and the `aon1-` hash stay symbolic: one finite string pins an
infinitely deep type. The vocabulary, one reference deep, from
`schema.aon`:

```aon
Step: approver: string & re("^[a-z]+@acme[.]example$")
Step: decision: *pending|pending|approved|rejected
Step: then?: $.spec.Step
```

A *required* recursive tail refuses at generation with
`recursion_unexpanded` at the exact position no finite document can
fill; guardedness is emergent, because the data decides. The chain,
vetted as plain JSON: [`use-cases/13-recursive-schema/`](../use-cases/13-recursive-schema/).

## 14. JSON Schema export

JSON Schema is the bridge out: an MCP tool's `inputSchema` must be
one, structured-output APIs constrain generation to one, OpenAPI
embeds one. `aontu jsonschema` exports the unified value as draft
2020-12 on stdout and names every loss on stderr; `--strict` turns a
lossy export into exit 1, and a dangling reference exports nothing
rather than a partial schema.

<!-- test: scenario jsonschema-export -->

Write a tool's argument schema as `registry.aon` (trimmed from the
case's registry):

<!-- test: file registry.aon -->
```aontu
argschemas: read_file: close({
  path: string & re("^[A-Za-z0-9._/\\-]+$") & re("^[a-z]") & length(max(512))
  max_bytes?: integer & min(1) & max(1048576)
})
```

Export it as the tool's `inputSchema`:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu jsonschema --at '$.argschemas.read_file' registry.aon
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "properties": {
    "max_bytes": {
      "maximum": 1048576,
      "minimum": 1,
      "type": "integer"
    },
    "path": {
      "allOf": [
        {
          "pattern": "^[A-Za-z0-9._/\\-]+$"
        },
        {
          "pattern": "^[a-z]"
        }
      ],
      "maxLength": 512,
      "minLength": 0,
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "path"
  ],
  "type": "object"
}
```

The two `re()` calls cross as an `allOf` of patterns, the closed map
becomes `additionalProperties: false`, and the optional key stays out
of `required`, with stderr empty, nothing was lost. The three moods
of the bridge (exact, lossy, refused):
[`use-cases/14-jsonschema-export/`](../use-cases/14-jsonschema-export/).

## 15. Code generation

The model is the source of the code. One catalogue of record types
feeds a Go generator, a TypeScript generator and a SQL generator, each
reading a different slice of it, and one `aontu render` turns the
three units into files. A generator is a rule set: `emit` walks the
records in source order and each node contributes *pieces* (a blank
line, a head, one line per field at depth 1, a tail) which the renderer
folds into bytes, owning every indent and every terminator. Names like
`Email` and `credit_cents` are written in the model rather than
derived, because what a type is called in a target is a fact about the
model, not a rule in a template.

<!-- test: scenario code-generation -->

Write the model and one generator as `types.aon`:

<!-- test: file types.aon -->
```aontu
records: [
  {
    name: "Customer"
    fields: [{ n:"id" t:"string" go:"ID" } { n:"email" t:"string" go:"Email" }]
  }
]

%field = emit(_, {
  match: n: string
  body: [
    {
      k: "line"
      at: 1
      of: [
        .go + " " + match(.t, "string", "string", "integer", "int64")
        + ` \`json:"` + .n + `"\``
      ]
    }
  ]
})

%record = emit(_, {
  match: name: string
  body: ["type " + .name + " struct {" emit(.fields, %field) "}"]
})

aontu: Code: units: [
  {
    path: "types.go"
    lang: "go"
    profile: indent: { unit:"\t" width:1 }
    decls: [{ k:"frag" of:emit($.records, %record) }]
  }
]
```

The struct comes out of the model, and the renderer puts the tab in
front of every depth-1 line:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu render --stdout types.aon
type Customer struct {
	ID string `json:"id"`
	Email string `json:"email"`
}
```

A rule set rather than `pack`, because list order is source order and
map keys sort by code point; a nested `emit` splices its pieces, so the
fragment reaches the renderer flat. `--out <dir>` writes every unit or
nothing, and `--check <dir>` holds the goldens in CI. The three
generators in one instance, their goldens, and a check that both ports
render identical bytes:
[`use-cases/15-code-generation/`](../use-cases/15-code-generation/).

## 16. Module deps

A codebase's own module graph: twelve modules across four layers,
where the architecture rule is that nothing may depend on a layer
above it. The rule is a shape rather than a checking pass. `rel(t)`
flows its target shape into every module an edge names, so a core
module's `dependsOn` carries `layer: "core" | "util"` to the far end,
and a module that says `layer: "feature"` cannot meet it. Each layer
is one line of schema and one disjunction, from `spec.aon`:

```aon
Core: $.spec.Mod & { layer:"core" dependsOn?:rel($.spec.CoreDep) }
CoreDep: { kind:mod layer:"core"|"util" }
```

An upward edge then refuses at generation as an ordinary conflict naming
both sides, and a loop between two modules of the *same* layer (which the
layering allows) refuses under `acyclic()`. The case pins the refusal in
both declaration orders. The same edges are drawn two ways and pinned as
goldens: a dependency tree, drawn by [`aontu view
tree`](reference-api.md#aontu-view) with derived roots and every
repeated subtree elided the way `cargo tree` elides one, and a
dependency-structure matrix. The layered codebase, its refusals, and its
views: [`use-cases/16-module-deps/`](../use-cases/16-module-deps/).

## 17. Lambda handlers

Twelve services on one message wire, each deployed as its own Lambda
handler: the same forty lines with three things that vary per
service. The generator is the handler file itself, as one rule set in
the canonical form a template file expands into: the body is the
file, line for line, and a value reaches a line through `replace`
rather than a hole:

```aon
%handler = emit(_, {
  match: name: string
  esc: sq
  replace: SERVICE: .name
  body: [
    "function complete(seneca: any) {"
    emit(.listen, {
      match: pin: string
      esc: sq
      replace: PIN: .pin
      body: ["  seneca.listen({type:'sqs',pin:'PIN'})"]
    })
    "}"
    "  let seneca = await getSeneca('SERVICE', complete)"
  ]
})
```

`SERVICE` and `PIN` are ordinary TypeScript in the body; the map says
which strings stand for a value, and `esc: sq` escapes each for the
single-quoted literal it lands in, so a service named `o'brien`
compiles. A service with no S3 events gets no gateway hook, because a
dispatch over an empty selection emits nothing, and the two lines of
two spaces in every handler survive because a line is verbatim. An
index names the services in the model's order through `each`, with a
constant spelled by `join(each(split(_, "-"), upper(_)), "_")`. All
thirteen files are held by `aontu render --check` in both ports:
[`use-cases/17-lambda-handlers/`](../use-cases/17-lambda-handlers/).
The same generator is there twice: `gen.aon` is the canonical aontu
above, and `handler.ts` is that generator written as a Lambda handler,
with its aontu on marked lines. Both render the same thirteen files.

## 18. Role permissions

Which role may change which subtree, asked before the change.
`roles.aon` is a `close()`d role vocabulary (`desc`, `allow`, `deny?`)
and a closed registry of four roles, `admin`, `dev`, `product` and
`qa`, over the service model in `model.aon`: services with an owner, a
tier, replicas and a description, a deploy layer with per-region
replicas, feature flags and a tests block. The vocabulary and the
`dev` role, from `roles.aon`:

```aon
Role: type(close({ desc:string allow: [&: string] deny?: [&: string] }))

roles: close({
  &: $.Role
  dev: {
    desc: "Runs the services: scaling and deployment, never ownership or tier"
    allow: ["$.services" "$.deploy.*.replicas"]
    deny: ["$.services.*.tier" "$.services.*.owner"]
  }
})
```

The agent skill asks `aontu allow` with the very assignment it is
about to hand `set`, and writes on exit 0 alone. A proposal at
`$.services.auth.replicas` lands in the overlay; one at
`$.services.auth.tier` is refused with the rule named, and so is one at
`$.services.auth`, because a change there could rewrite the tier:

```
$ aontu allow --role dev roles.aon '$.services.auth.tier="standard"'
verdict: refused
role: dev
$.services.auth.tier: refused by $.roles.dev.deny.0 ($.services.*.tier)
```

Exit 1, and `aontu why '$.roles.dev.deny.0' roles.aon` names the line
that wrote the rule. A role-model edit that puts a string where the
`allow` list goes, or adds a key the closed vocabulary does not
declare, is exit 4 with the engine's own finding, so the rules are
held to the same shape as everything else. The roles, the proposals
and the skill:
[`use-cases/18-role-permissions/`](../use-cases/18-role-permissions/).
