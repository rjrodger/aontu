description: Rewrite a pinned literal where the author wrote it with aontu set --in-place, and know the cases where the verb appends instead.

# Change a pinned value

Appending cannot change a pinned value: the append makes two concrete
facts at one path, and the lattice refuses both. `--in-place` closes
the loop by rewriting the literal where the author wrote it. To see
both behaviours, write a `schema.aon` that constrains the fields:

<!-- test: scenario change-pinned -->
<!-- test: file schema.aon -->
```aontu
replicas: integer & min(1) & max(24)
port: integer
```

and a `deploy.aon` overlay that pins them, comments included:

<!-- test: file deploy.aon -->
```aontu
# the deployment
replicas: 42 # too many
port: 0x1F
```

Plain [`aontu set`](change-a-value-with-an-overlay.md) refuses,
because the overlay would then disagree with itself:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu set '$.replicas=5' --entry schema.aon --overlay deploy.aon
verdict: invalid

$.replicas: scalar_value [conflict]
  [aontu/scalar_value]: Cannot unify values at path $.replicas
  data: deploy.aon:4:13 (5)
  data: deploy.aon:2:11 (42)
$ echo $?
1
```

Both sites are labelled `data:`: the pin and the contradiction live
in the same file, which is exactly why appending cannot help. Add
`--in-place` and the literal is rewritten instead:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu set '$.replicas=5' --entry schema.aon --overlay deploy.aon --in-place
verdict: valid
replaced: deploy.aon:2:11 42 -> 5
wrote: deploy.aon
$ echo $?
0
```

The file now reads:

```aon
# the deployment
replicas: 5 # too many
port: 0x1F
```

Comments and layout survive, including the one on the edited line,
because nothing is re-serialised: the span at `(row, col, len)` is
replaced and every other byte is left exactly as it was. The edit is
also verified before it is written: a site carries the source text
it claims to cover, and the text at the span must match it. That is
what makes a hex literal safe to rewrite even though its *value* is
`31`:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu set '$.port=80' --entry schema.aon --overlay deploy.aon --in-place
verdict: valid
replaced: deploy.aon:3:7 0x1F -> 80
wrote: deploy.aon
```

The report speaks in source text (`0x1F -> 80`), because replacing a
spelling is a different edit from replacing a value.

Where it cannot rewrite, it appends as plain `set` would and says why
in a warning. A warning never moves a verdict, so `--in-place` is
never worse than `set` without it:

| the overlay says | why not | what happens |
|---|---|---|
| `a: min(1)`, `a: 1+2`, `a: {b:1}` | the site names the opening token of a compound, not the whole value | appended, `patch_not_editable` |
| `a: 1` twice | two statements pin it; there is no single place to edit | appended, `patch_ambiguous` |
| a `&:` template, a `$ref` | the value comes from elsewhere; edit it there | appended, `patch_not_editable` |
| `a: integer`, `a: above(0)` | a constraint, not a pin: appending narrows it without discarding it | appended, `patch_not_editable` |
| anything, when the overlay itself `@"includes"` another document | a loaded literal's position cannot be told from the overlay's own | appended, `patch_not_editable` |

A default (`a: *1`) is not in the table: appending already overrides
it correctly, so `--in-place` leaves it alone and says nothing.

The last row cuts both ways, and the reverse direction is easy to get
wrong. To change a value that lives in an *included* file, name that
file as the overlay, but give `--entry` something that constrains the
value without also pulling the file in. Write a `stack.aon` entry that
loads `deploy.aon`, the natural arrangement and the wrong one here:

<!-- test: file stack.aon -->
```aontu
@"./deploy.aon"
replicas: integer & min(1) & max(24)
port: integer
```

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu set '$.replicas=9' --entry stack.aon --overlay deploy.aon --in-place
verdict: invalid
would replace: deploy.aon:2:11 5 -> 9

$.replicas: scalar_value [conflict]
  [aontu/scalar_value]: Cannot unify values at path $.replicas
  data: deploy.aon:2:11 (9)
  schema: deploy.aon:2:11 (5)
$ echo $?
1
```

The overlay's value [meets](../unification.md) *itself* through the
entry's include, so the run is refused and nothing is written. `would
replace:` (rather than `replaced:`) tells you the edit itself was
possible and the conflict lay elsewhere: here, in the shape of the
invocation. Pass `schema.aon` as the entry, as the earlier runs do, and
the same command holds. ([Why the tool refuses the shape instead of
detecting the
collision](../explanation.md#the-emit--validate--repair-loop).)

Pair `--in-place` with `--dry-run` to see the rewritten overlay
without writing it. The full editability rules are under [`aontu
set`](../reference-api.md#aontu-set); after any refusal, [`aontu
why`](explain-a-value.md) lists every line involved; and the live
version, an ops overlay repeatedly rewritten in place, is
[use-cases/08-feature-flags](../../use-cases/08-feature-flags/).
