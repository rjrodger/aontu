description: Connect `aontu lsp` to VS Code, Neovim, or any LSP client for diagnostics as you type.

# Wire your editor

Both implementations serve the Language Server Protocol from the
command itself, `aontu lsp`: unification problems as diagnostics
while you type, with hover and completion beside them. Ready-made
plugins for VS Code, Emacs and Vim/Neovim live in
[`editors/`](../../editors/), each a thin client that launches the
server, with install steps in its README. The recipes below are for
wiring a client yourself.

The facts every client needs: the command is `aontu` with the one
argument `lsp`, the transport is stdio, and the document selector is
the `aontu` language (`.aon` is the preferred extension, `.aontu` also
works, `.jsonic` is retired). The server has no configuration options.
The standalone `aontu-lsp` binary that earlier configurations name
still ships and runs the same server.

Get the command any way the [CLI guide](run-cli-and-repl.md) lists:
`npm install -g aontu`, a built binary, or `go install`. The two builds
are interchangeable from a client's point of view
([running the server](../lsp.md#running-the-server)).

## VS Code

There is no published extension; the smallest path is a tiny custom
extension whose `activate` starts the server with
[`vscode-languageclient`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-languageclient):

<!-- test: skip VS Code extension wiring; the server contract is pinned by ts/test/lsp.test.ts -->
```ts
import { workspace, ExtensionContext } from 'vscode'
import { LanguageClient, TransportKind } from 'vscode-languageclient/node'

export function activate(_ctx: ExtensionContext) {
  const server = { command: 'aontu', args: ['lsp'], transport: TransportKind.stdio }
  const client = new LanguageClient(
    'aontu',
    'aontu',
    { run: server, debug: server },
    { documentSelector: [{ scheme: 'file', language: 'aontu' }] },
  )
  client.start()
}
```

From a checkout, use
`{ module: '/abs/path/to/aontu/ts/bin/aontu-lsp.js', transport: TransportKind.stdio }`
for the TypeScript server, or `command: '/abs/path/to/go/aontu'` with
the same `args` for a Go build.

## Neovim (built-in LSP)

<!-- test: skip Neovim configuration; the server contract is pinned by ts/test/lsp.test.ts and go/lsp/serve_test.go -->
```lua
vim.filetype.add({ extension = { aon = 'aontu', aontu = 'aontu' } })

vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('FileType', {
  pattern = 'aontu',
  callback = function(args)
    vim.lsp.start({
      name = 'aontu',
      cmd = { 'aontu', 'lsp' },        -- or { 'node', '/abs/path/ts/bin/aontu-lsp.js' }
      root_dir = vim.fs.dirname(args.file),
    })
  end,
})
```

The filetype registration covers both extensions; the shipped
[vim plugin](../../editors/vim/) does the same and adds syntax
highlighting.

## Any LSP client

Configure a server whose command is `aontu` with the argument `lsp`
(or `node …/aontu-lsp.js`), transport stdio, document selector the
`aontu` language / `*.aon` glob. No initialization options are
required. One is available: hover provenance, which appends to each
hover the contributions record `aontu why` prints: ask for it and
pay a second evaluation per hover, or leave it off and pay nothing
([LSP hover provenance](../reference-api.md#lsp-hover-provenance)):

<!-- test: skip editor initialization sample; the hover surface is pinned by ts/test/lsp.test.ts -->
```json
{ "initializationOptions": { "aontu": { "provenance": true } } }
```

What you will and will not see: the server flags contradictions,
unresolved references and unknown constructs, and stays silent on
schemas and partial documents: non-concrete is valid, so your
half-written model does not light up red
([how diagnostics are
computed](../lsp.md#how-diagnostics-are-computed)).

The full reference (architecture, both library APIs, the protocol
surface) is [the LSP page](../lsp.md). The same contributions record
the hover option shows is yours at the command line with
[explain a value](explain-a-value.md).
