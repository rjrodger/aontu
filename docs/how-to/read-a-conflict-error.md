# Read a conflict error

A conflict message names both operands, and it pays to know which is
which. For two plain facts [meeting](../unification.md) at a path, the
later-in-source one is named first:

```
Cannot unify value: 2 with value: 1
```

means two facts reached the same path (`1` earlier, `2` later) and
they cannot both hold. To see everything the engine prints around
that line, write `clash.aon`:

<!-- test: scenario conflict -->
<!-- test: file clash.aon -->
<!-- fmt: keep two writers, one statement each -->
```aontu
a: b: 1
a: b: 2
```

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu clash.aon
[aontu/scalar_value]: Cannot unify values at path $.a.b
...
 Cannot unify value: 2 with value: 1
  --> clash.aon:2:7
...
 Cannot unify value: 1 with value: 2
  --> clash.aon:1:7
...
$ echo $?
1
```

Read it top to bottom. The `[aontu/scalar_value]` line carries the error
code and the path; a hint block restates the rule that was broken; then
each operand appears with an annotated source frame: file, line, column,
and the offending text with a caret under it. Note the path: a nested
conflict reports the leaf values that clashed, so `a:b:1` against
`a:b:2` is that same one-line message at `$.a.b`, not a complaint about
`a`.

Where the conflict is reached through a disjunction, a list spread or
a reference, both operands are still named but the ordering heuristic
no longer applies: the value "later in source" may have travelled.
Trust the two source frames, not the order.

An unresolved path is a different failure, with a different code:

```
[aontu/no_path]: Cannot resolve value at path $.x
```

Nothing contradicted anything; a `$.reference` names a key the
document does not have. (An undefined `$name` variable is
`[aontu/unknown_var]`, a third case: see [inject host
values](inject-host-values.md).)

The error codes, spelled as they render, are catalogued in the
language reference under [Errors](../reference-language.md#errors).
To see every contribution that met at a path (including the ones
that agreed), [explain a value](explain-a-value.md); to gather every
failure in one pass instead of reading them one throw at a time,
[collect errors](collect-errors.md).
