# Tutorial: build a config that checks itself

A service config needs values, constraints, and defaults. In aontu,
you can write all three in one document and combine them through
[unification](unification.md).

Build a config, validate data against it, and find which statement set
a value. Each step shows source and output checked by the test suite.
For the reasoning behind the operation, read the
[explanation](explanation.md).

## 1. Set up

If aontu is already installed, skip to [§2](#2-objects-are-just-keys-and-values).

### TypeScript

Install and build inside the repo's `ts/` directory:

<!-- test: skip environment setup; npm and node are outside the transcript vocabulary -->
```sh
cd ts
npm install
npm run build      # compiles src + test into dist/ and dist-test/
```

A scratch `play.js` next to `ts/` is enough to call the library:

<!-- test: skip TypeScript API sample; the API is pinned by ts/test/aontu.test.ts -->
```js
const { Aontu } = require('aontu')   // when installed from npm
// from inside this repo: require('./ts/dist/aontu')

const aontu = new Aontu()
console.log(aontu.generate('hello: world'))
// { hello: 'world' }
```

`generate` takes aontu source text and returns a plain JavaScript
value. That is the whole API surface you need today.

### Go

The Go port lives in `go/`:

<!-- test: skip environment setup; go is outside the transcript vocabulary -->
```sh
cd go
go test ./...      # confirms the toolchain works
```

A scratch `main.go`:

<!-- test: skip Go API sample; the API is pinned by go/aontu_test.go -->
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	aontu "github.com/aontu-lang/aontu/go"
)

func main() {
	out, err := aontu.New().Generate("hello: world")
	fmt.Println(out, err)        // map[hello:world] <nil>
}
```

The two implementations accept the same source and produce the same
shape; the parity is pinned by one test suite both implementations
run. The rest of this page shows source and result: run
them in whichever language you keep at hand.

### The `aontu` command

Both implementations also ship an `aontu` command, and this page
writes its CLI moments as transcripts of it. From a clone the command
is `node ts/bin/aontu.js` (or `go run ./cmd/aontu` from inside `go/`);
installed from npm (`npm i -g aontu`) it is plain `aontu`, which is
how the transcripts spell it. Pipe a snippet in:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ echo 'a:1 b:$.a' | aontu
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": 1
}
```

`b` followed a reference to `a` before printing: even a piped
one-liner is fully evaluated. Run `aontu` with no file and you get a
REPL; the [API reference](reference-api.md#command-line-interface)
covers both.

## 2. Objects are just keys and values

aontu source reads as relaxed JSON (it is parsed by
[`@tabnas/jsonic`](https://github.com/tabnas/jsonic), so quotes,
commas and braces are mostly optional). Plain data is legal on its
own:

```aontu
name: Mercury
order: 1
rocky: true
```

→

```json
{ "name": "Mercury", "order": 1, "rocky": true }
```

No quotes on `Mercury`, no braces, no commas; the output is ordinary
JSON all the same.

Nesting repeats keys with a colon: `a:b:c:1` means
`a: { b: { c: 1 } }`:

<!-- fmt: keep two statements meeting is the lesson -->
```aontu
server: host: localhost
server: port: 8080
```

→

```json
{ "server": { "host": "localhost", "port": 8080 } }
```

The two `server:` lines did not collide. They merged, and that merge
is your first unification.

## 3. Unification: combining facts

Stating two things about the same place combines them. The explicit
operator is `&`; between map keys it happens on its own:

<!-- fmt: keep two statements meeting is the lesson -->
```aontu
server: { host: localhost }
server: { port: 8080 }
```

→

```json
{ "server": { "host": "localhost", "port": 8080 } }
```

Where the statements agree, or one is more specific, unification keeps
the combination. Where they disagree, we want an error, and we get
one:

```aontu
port: 8080
port: 9090
```

→ fails with:

```
[aontu/scalar_value]: Cannot unify values at path $.port

Cannot unify value: 9090 with value: 8080
```

(Trimmed; the real message also quotes both source lines, with a
caret under each.) Combining information can only narrow toward a
single answer or fail loudly. aontu never picks one fact over the
other silently.

## 4. Types as values

A bare type name is a value too: it means "any value of this kind".
Unify it with a concrete value and the value wins, provided it fits:

```aontu
port: integer
port: 8080
```

→

```json
{ "port": 8080 }
```

And when it does not fit:

```aontu
port: integer
port: "high"
```

→ fails with:

```
[aontu/no_scalar_unify]: Cannot unify values at path $.port

Cannot unify value: "high" with value: integer
```

The built-in kinds are `string`, `boolean`, `top` (the catch-all that
admits anything), and the numeric family: `number` covers every
numeric value, over its four leaves `integer`, `float`, `biginteger`
and `bigdecimal`. Say `number` when you mean "some number", and name a
leaf when you mean that leaf: `port: integer` will not accept
`8080.5`. Your config now carries the first piece of its own schema.

## 5. Exact numbers with `0d`

An ordinary aontu number, like an ordinary JSON number, is a binary
floating-point value. For a port or a timeout that is fine. For money
and for large identifiers it is not, because binary cannot represent
every decimal:

```aontu
total: 0.1 + 0.2
```

→

```json
{ "total": 0.30000000000000004 }
```

Prefix the literals with `0d` and the arithmetic is exact, stored as
decimal digits and computed without rounding:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ echo 'total: 0d0.1 + 0d0.2' | aontu
{
  "total": 0.3
}
```

The prefix is source syntax only; the digits generate as an ordinary
JSON number. Whole digits give a `biginteger` (`0d5`); a decimal
point or an exponent gives a `bigdecimal` (`0d19.99`, `0d1e3`).
Neither has a practical size limit.

The same care shows up as a refusal. A literal that cannot be stored
without silently becoming a different number is not stored:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ echo 'id: 9007199254740993' | aontu
[aontu/lossy_integer_literal]: Cannot resolve value at path $.id

This integer literal, 9007199254740993, is not exactly representable in
binary64, so storing it would silently round it to a DIFFERENT
number. aontu refuses rather than corrupts: write it as a `0d`
literal to get the exact integer.
...
$ echo $?
1
```

That value is 2^53+1, just past where doubles start skipping whole
numbers. Take the hint:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ echo 'id: 0d9007199254740993' | aontu
{
  "id": 9007199254740993
}
```

The exact ID survives to the output. One thing to remember when you
write the schema: an exact value is a `biginteger` or a `bigdecimal`,
never an `integer`, so constrain it with the exact leaf (or with
`number`, which admits any numeric leaf).

## 6. Defaults with `*`

Mark a value as a **default** with `*`. A default is used only when
nothing more specific is supplied:

```aontu
port: *8080 | integer
```

→

```json
{ "port": 8080 }
```

The `|` is **disjunction**, a choice between alternatives (`8080` or
any `integer`), and the `*` says which branch to take when nothing
forces the choice. Unify a concrete value on top and it wins:

```aontu
port: *8080 | integer
port: 9090
```

→

```json
{ "port": 9090 }
```

Now try a float:

```aontu
port: *8080 | integer
port: 1.5
```

→ fails with:

```
[aontu/empty]: Cannot unify values at path $.port

Empty disjunction. The disjunction has no valid alternatives.
```

An override must be admitted by one of the branches you wrote, and
`1.5` is a `float`, which `integer` does not admit: why the gate is
this strict is argued in the
[explanation](explanation.md#a-preference-is-gated-by-kind-not-by-family).
When any number should be able to win, say so in the branch:

```aontu
port: *8080 | number
port: 1.5
```

→

```json
{ "port": 1.5 }
```

`*value | kind` is the shape to remember: the kind you write is the
kind you get. The full rule, including enums with defaults, is in the
[language reference](reference-language.md#preference--default-).

## 7. References

Pull a value from elsewhere in the document with a path; `$.` starts
at the root:

```aontu
defaults: timeout: 30
service: timeout: $.defaults.timeout
```

→

```json
{ "defaults": { "timeout": 30 }, "service": { "timeout": 30 } }
```

Change the default once and every reader of the path follows. A
leading `.` is relative to the current object, and `key()` names the
key a value is stored under: a compact way to give records their own
name:

```aontu
users: { alice:id:key() bob:id:key() }
```

→

```json
{ "users": { "alice": { "id": "alice" }, "bob": { "id": "bob" } } }
```

Each record read its own key. The [graph tutorial](tutorial-graph.md)
picks this thread up again, where names become identities.

## 8. Templates with `&:` (spread)

A `&:` entry inside a map is a **template** unified into every sibling
key. Declare a shape once and it applies everywhere:

```aontu
servers: { &: { region:*"us-east" | string active:*true | boolean } }
servers: web: region: "eu-west"
servers: db: {}
```

→

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "db":  { "active": true, "region": "us-east" },
    "web": { "active": true, "region": "eu-west" }
  }
}
```

`web` overrode the default region; `db` supplied nothing and took both
defaults; the template itself does not appear in the output. Spreads
work in lists too (`[&: {...}]`), and §11 leans on that form.

## 9. Functions

aontu has a fixed set of built-in functions, and no user-defined ones.
A few of the everyday ones:

```aontu
web: region: "eu-west"
name: upper(mercury) # -> "MERCURY"
slug: lower(Mercury) # -> "mercury"
label: a + b + c # -> "abc"
copy: copy($.web) # deep copy of another node
```

→

```json
{
  "copy":  { "region": "eu-west" },
  "label": "abc",
  "name":  "MERCURY",
  "slug":  "mercury",
  "web":   { "region": "eu-west" }
}
```

`+` concatenates strings and adds numbers; `upper` and `lower` double
as ceiling and floor on numbers, and they keep exact numbers exact
(`upper(0d1.1)` prints `2.0`, a `bigdecimal` ceiling). There are
forty-two built-ins in all (bounds, pattern and length
constraints, generators that build children, `join` to fold a bag into
a line of text) tabulated with tested examples in the
[language reference](reference-language.md#functions).
You need none of the rest today.

## 10. Sealing a shape with `close`

A map is **open** by default: unifying in extra keys is allowed, which
is what lets separate files contribute separate keys. A schema usually
wants the opposite. `close()` seals a shape:

```aontu
point: close({ x:number y:number })
point: { x:1 y:2 }
```

→

```json
{ "point": { "x": 1, "y": 2 } }
```

Add a key the shape does not declare and the document refuses:

```aontu
point: close({ x:number y:number })
point: { x:1 y:2 z:3 }
```

→ fails with:

```
[aontu/closed]: Cannot resolve value at path $.point.z

Cannot add to closed structure.
```

`open()` reverses it. How open a schema should be is a genuine design
dial; [closed values](reference-language.md#closed-values-close--open)
has the mechanics, and the
[explanation](explanation.md#closed-world-validation-is-a-dial) the
trade-off.

## 11. Putting it together

Time to spend all of it. Here is a single document that is schema,
defaults and data at once: save it as `config.aon`:

<!-- test: scenario service-config -->
<!-- test: file config.aon -->
```aontu
# --- schema + defaults (could live in its own file) ---
service: close({
  name: string
  host: *localhost | string
  port: *8080 | integer
  rate: *0d0.01 | bigdecimal
  tags: [&: string]
})

# --- environment data merged on top ---
service: { name:api port:9090 rate:0d0.025 tags:[public http] }
```

Run it:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu config.aon
{
  "service": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "name": "api",
    "port": 9090,
    "rate": 0.025,
    "tags": [
      "public",
      "http"
    ]
  }
}
```

Every default is `*value | kind`, the §6 shape, so `port: 9090.5` is
refused rather than accepted. And `tags` says `[&: string]` where
`[string]` might look like enough: a list literal is positional, so
`[string]` constrains element 0 and waves `tags: [public, 7]` through;
the [explanation](explanation.md#a-list-literal-is-positional) argues
why it works that way.

With those two spellings in place the schema constrains every field.
Defaults filled `host`, the data supplied the rest, `rate` stayed exact
from `0d0.025` to the printed `0.025`, and `close` kept stray keys
out: one answer, assembled by unification, which would have failed loudly
had anything conflicted.

## 12. Asking the document questions

You have written something that says quite a lot. From here on, stop
reading it and start asking it. `get` prints one slice of the answer:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu get '$.service.tags' config.aon
[
  "public",
  "http"
]
```

The path is the same `$.`-rooted path §7 used for references: quote
it so the shell leaves the `$` alone.

`why` is the verb to reach for when a value surprises you. It names
every statement that contributed to a path, in source order:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu why '$.service.port' config.aon
$.service.port = 9090
  1. *8080|integer  config.aon:5:9
  2. 9090  config.aon:11:26
```

Two contributions, and you wrote both: the default with its type, and
the data that beat it, each with the line and column it came from. The
first line is the *whole* written value: a contribution is a
statement, so the `8080` and the `integer` arrive together, as the
single value they were written as. Now ask about `host`, which nothing
overrode:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu why '$.service.host' config.aon
$.service.host = *"localhost"|string
  1. *"localhost"|string  config.aon:4:9
```

One contribution, still wearing its `*`: the default answered only
because nothing outranked it. `get` has `--keys`, `--types` and
`--canon` views as well, and the rest of the verb surface is
tabulated in the
[API reference](reference-api.md#command-line-interface);
[query a path](how-to/query-a-path.md) and
[explain a value](how-to/explain-a-value.md) put these two to work.

## 13. Validating data with `aontu vet`

Configuration rarely stays in one file: the schema is yours, the data
arrives from somewhere else. Split `config.aon` at its comment. The
schema half becomes `service.aon`:

<!-- test: file service.aon -->
```aontu
service: close({
  name: string
  host: *localhost | string
  port: *8080 | integer
  rate: *0d0.01 | bigdecimal
  tags: [&: string]
})
```

and the data half becomes `prod.aon`:

<!-- test: file prod.aon -->
```aontu
service: { name:api port:9090 rate:0d0.025 tags:[public http] }
```

`vet` asks whether a data document holds against a schema document:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu vet service.aon prod.aon
verdict: valid
```

Now a second environment arrives, `staging.aon`, written by someone
else:

<!-- test: file staging.aon -->
```aontu
service: { name:search port:8100 tags:[internal 3] }
```

Vet it:

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu vet service.aon staging.aon
verdict: invalid

$.service.tags.1: no_scalar_unify [conflict]
  [aontu/no_scalar_unify]: Cannot unify values at path $.service.tags.1
  data: staging.aon:1:49 (3)
  schema: service.aon:6:13 (string)
$ echo $?
1
```

Read the finding from the top. The path `$.service.tags.1` is exactly
where the trouble is: element 1 of the list, the `3`. Then **two
sites**, because a conflict is always between two statements and neither
one owns the blame: `data` is what arrived (`3`, line 4, column 20 of
`staging.aon`) and `schema` is what it had to [meet](unification.md)
(`string`, line 6, column 16 of `service.aon`). Every finding is sited
on both sides, so you never guess which file to open. And the exit code,
`1`, is the verdict class: a CI job needs nothing else.

The `3` was meant to be a tier name. Write `staging.aon` again, saying
so:

<!-- test: file staging.aon -->
```aontu
service: { name:search port:8100 tags:[internal tier3] }
```

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu vet service.aon staging.aon
verdict: valid
```

Notice `staging.aon` never mentions `host` or `rate` and passes
anyway: the schema's defaults stand in. To see what the service
actually gets, unify the two files: a document that loads both is all
it takes. Write `stack.aon`:

<!-- test: file stack.aon -->
```aontu
@"service.aon"
@"staging.aon"
```

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu stack.aon
{
  "service": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "name": "search",
    "port": 8100,
    "rate": 0.01,
    "tags": [
      "internal",
      "tier3"
    ]
  }
}
```

`@"file"` loads a source file and unifies it in place, which is all
"multi-file" means here;
[split a model across files](how-to/split-a-model-across-files.md)
grows the idea into versioned, vendored dependencies.

`vet` has a third verdict, and it is the one that stops the loop
calling an unfinished document valid. Delete the `name` line from `staging.aon`:

<!-- test: file staging.aon -->
```aontu
service: { port:8100 tags:[internal tier3] }
```

<!-- test: run -->
```sh
$ aontu vet service.aon staging.aon
verdict: incomplete

$.service.name: mapval_required [incomplete]
  [aontu/mapval_required]: Cannot resolve value at path $.service.name
  schema: service.aon:2:9 (string)
$ echo $?
3
```

Nothing contradicts anything; the document is simply not finished yet.
aontu has kept "wrong" and "unfinished" apart all through this page,
and `vet` keeps them apart in its exit codes too: one code per
verdict class, which is what makes it usable as a gate. The codes, the
JSON and SARIF report forms and `--watch` are specified under
[`aontu vet`](reference-api.md#aontu-vet), and
[validate in CI](how-to/validate-in-ci.md) is the recipe.

That is the loop the whole verb surface exists for: **emit** a
document, **vet** it against the truth it has to satisfy, and when it
fails, let the two sites and `aontu why` say where to **repair** it.
You have now run it once by hand, which matters, because repair is the
step you will eventually hand to a command: `aontu set` rewrites
overlay files under exactly these rules, and
[change a pinned value](how-to/change-a-pinned-value.md) shows what it
will and will not touch.

## Where to go next

Your config is a tree. Real systems are graphs: services that depend
on each other, ownership that must not cycle, schemas that contain
themselves. The [graph tutorial](tutorial-graph.md) is the second half
of this one: identity, relations, reachability and recursion, on the
engine you just used.

For a task you already have, go straight to its guide:

-  **Run, embed and integrate**: [call from
  TypeScript](how-to/call-from-typescript.md), [call from
  Go](how-to/call-from-go.md), [read a conflict
  error](how-to/read-a-conflict-error.md)
-  **Templates, defaults and composition**: [provide
  defaults](how-to/provide-defaults.md), [apply a template to many
  keys](how-to/apply-a-template-to-many-keys.md)
-  **Schemas and constraints**: [constrain list
  elements](how-to/constrain-list-elements.md), [make a field
  optional](how-to/make-a-field-optional.md)
-  **Query, explain and change**: [query a path](how-to/query-a-path.md),
  [explain a value](how-to/explain-a-value.md)
-  **Validate and evolve**: [validate in CI](how-to/validate-in-ci.md),
  [gate schema changes](how-to/gate-schema-changes.md)
-  **Modules and multi-file**: [split a model across
  files](how-to/split-a-model-across-files.md)

Every rule and edge case is in the
[language reference](reference-language.md); the command and both APIs
are in the [API reference](reference-api.md); the reasons are in the
[explanation](explanation.md).
