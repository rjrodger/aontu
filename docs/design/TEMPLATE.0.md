# The template surface: generators written in the target's own syntax

*Design note, 2026-09-04. The sugar that desugars to
[EMIT.0.md](EMIT.0.md)'s `emit`, and the three string builtins it needs
— `esc`, `usc`, `rep` and `split`. Companion to
[G9](../capability-review/g9-transformation.md), which is the plan.
Every claim marked VERIFIED was run against the built CLIs at 0.56.0
and, for output claims, against
[`voxgig/podmind`](https://github.com/voxgig/podmind)'s backend at
`ab7f333`. This note is design; status lives in the
[progress register](../capability-review/progress.md).*

**Names here are the names of the day.** This document records what was
decided when it was written, and it is not rewritten as the language
moves. Two names have since changed meaning. The list generator it
calls `form` is named `each` today
([ADR-027](../../ADR.md#adr-027--the-list-generator-is-named-each-and-_--t-is-its-bound)),
and the `each` it describes as the bound was retired first
([ADR-026](../../ADR.md#adr-026--each-is-retired-form-carries-the-bound)), that
bound now being spelled `each(d, _ & t)`. The
[progress register](../capability-review/progress.md) carries the current status, and
`test/spec/signature.tsv` is the call surface.

## D1. One rule

A generator is a file in the TARGET's syntax. **A marked line is aontu
source; every other line is a line of output.** That is the entire
desugaring, and it round-trips: a marked line becomes aontu verbatim,
an unmarked line becomes a list element in the enclosing template's
`body`.

Nothing else is borrowed from the target's space at the line level, and
nothing target-shaped is borrowed into aontu: **no line of target code
appears inside an aontu string.**

## D2. The marker is the target's comment token plus a dash

`//-`, `#-`, `---`, and the block form `/*- … */` where the language
has no line comment. One rule, derivable for a language the profile
table has never seen, and quieter on the page than a colon — which
matters, because a generator file is mostly marker lines and mostly
read rather than written.

A marker is recognised **after leading whitespace**, and its own
indentation counts toward the aontu it carries.

**AMENDED 2026-09-07.** The round trip used to write that indentation
back **before** the marker, so a marker line sat where its output would.
That serves a reader of the target, and it costs the reader of the
DOCUMENT the one thing the surface took away: the tree the marker lines
carry had no shape on the page at all. The resugaring now writes the
marker at the **left margin** with the aontu indented **after** it,
which is what `aontu fmt` (FMT.0.md §3.14) produces:

```rb
#- code: units: [
#-   {
#-     path: "config/routes.rb"
#-     decls: [
#-       { k: "frag", of: [
Rails.application.routes.draw do
#-       ]}
```

The half of D7 this rests on is untouched: an **output** line is
verbatim, at its own indentation, so a template is still written exactly
where its output appears. Reading is unchanged and stays generous — a
template written the other way desugars to the same document — so what
changed is the spelling the round trip answers, and `template --check`
names the difference as the drift it is.

## D3. A value reaches the output through `replace`, not a delimiter

A template may carry a `replace` map. **Its key is an exact string the
body already contains as ordinary target text**; its value is an
expression evaluated against the matched node.

```ts
  //- emit(.client, {match: {pin: string}, esc: sq, replace: {PIN: .pin}, body: [
  seneca.client({type:'sqs',pin:'PIN'})
  //- ]}),
```

`pin:'PIN'` is ordinary TypeScript. There is no hole syntax in it at
all, and that is the point.

### Why not an inline hole

Two spellings were built and measured before this one, and both failed
on the same rock: **any inline delimiter is somebody's syntax.**

`${expr}` breaks twice on this project's own material. The assessed
backend's model carries the bucket name
`podmind01-backend01-file02-${self:provider.stage}`, and a serverless
template must emit `${self:provider.stage}` verbatim — VERIFIED, the
desugaring ate it. And a generated TypeScript file holding
`` log(`handler ${name} ready`) `` collides twice, on `${}` and on the
backtick the canonical form quoted with.

`<-expr->` is better and still not safe. Tested against realistic lines
from twenty languages, **it breaks in ten of twenty-five**:

| clean | breaks |
| --- | --- |
| TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Python, Rust, Java, Kotlin, PHP, Clojure, SQL, shell, YAML, JSON | Haskell, Scala, Elixir, Erlang, F#, OCaml, Coq, R, Markdown and other prose, HTML comments, C++ in one style |

The breaks are ordinary code — `xs <- mapM (\x -> f x) ys`,
`for (k <- m) yield k -> v`, `x <- c(1,2); 3 -> y`. **There is no
universally safe ASCII pair**, and a design that picks one and moves on
is wrong somewhere it has not looked.

`replace` removes the question rather than answering it. There is no
delimiter to collide, so no profile data, no per-file override, and no
parse-check refusal to write. It also **simplifies the canonical
form**: a body line is a plain string with no concatenation at all —
VERIFIED, zero `+` in the canonical form of the worked generator, where
the hole spelling had one per hole.

### The three substitution rules

1. **A single left-to-right pass over the literal line.** At each
   position the longest matching key wins.
2. **A substituted value is never re-scanned**, so no value can
   introduce a key. This is what keeps substitution from becoming an
   injection channel of its own.
3. **A template's replacements apply to its own literal body lines
   only**, never to results spliced in from a nested `emit`. Those
   carry their own template's replacements and are finished.

### The two static checks

Both look only at the template, before any data — the flavour of static
check the rule layer exists to make possible:

| code | when | why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `replace_overlap` | one key is a substring of another | ambiguous whatever the order |
| `replace_unused` | a key matches nothing in the body | the template drifted from its map |

VERIFIED, both fire: `replace_overlap: key "P" is inside "PIN"`, and
`replace_unused: key "NOPE" matches nothing in the body`.

**The residual risk is an accidental match** — a key that is also
genuine target text somewhere in the body. `replace_unused` cannot
catch that, and no mechanism can; the mitigation is the same convention
every fragment-replacement tool uses, an upper-case placeholder that
reads as a placeholder. It is a narrower risk than a delimiter's,
because the author chooses the key against a body they can see.

## D4. Escaping: `esc`, `usc`, and escaped by default

```
esc(src: string, variant?: string) : string
usc(src: string, variant?: string) : string
```

Interpolation without escaping is the oldest bug in code generation,
and this surface had it. VERIFIED, with a service named `o'brien` and a
pin of `it's,a:pin`:

```
  let s = await getSeneca('o'brien', complete)
  seneca.client({type:'sqs',pin:'it's,a:pin'})
```

`tsc` rejects that with nine errors. Through the escape it is
`'o\'brien'` and `'it\'s,a:pin'` — **0 errors**, VERIFIED against the
same compiler.

**`esc` is an ordinary string builtin.** It sits beside `upper` and
`lower`, returns a string, composes with `+`, and has no renderer
coupling, so it can land before the profiles do. The name is free in
both ports' function tables, as is `usc`.

**With no variant it is the C escape, JSON canonical** — `\\`, `\"`,
`\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\b`, `\f`, and control characters as `\uXXXX`. That
one convention covers TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, C#, Go,
Rust, Swift, Kotlin, Scala and JSON itself, which is why it is the
default rather than a lookup.

**A variant names a CONVENTION, not a language**, and that is why it is
a variant rather than profile data: several languages share one
convention, and one language has several — a C-family literal escapes
differently in each quote, and SQL spells a literal one way and an
identifier another.

| variant | convention | needed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *(none)* | C / JSON, double-quoted | the TypeScript and Go profiles, and JSON output |
| `sq` | single-quoted C-family | the handlers themselves — they write `pin:'…'` |
| `sql` | `''` doubling, standard SQL | the SQL profile |
| `shell` | POSIX single-quote, `'` → `'\''` | generated scripts |
| `xml` | the five entities; covers HTML | any markup target |
| `uri` | percent-encoding | generated URLs and paths |
| `regex` | metacharacters (`regex`, not `re`, which is a builtin) | patterns built from model data |

An unknown variant is a located refusal at the call, never a
pass-through. New conventions arrive by name — Terraform's `$${`/`%%{`
is the obvious next — rather than by teaching a profile a new
behaviour.

**`usc` is the left inverse, and it is partial.** `usc(esc(s)) == s`
for every `s`; `esc(usc(t)) == t` only for canonically escaped `t`,
because several spellings escape to the same value (`\x41` and `A`).
Malformed input — a truncated `\u12`, an undefined `\q` — has no
inverse and is a located refusal (`usc_malformed`), not a
pass-through. It earns its place beyond generation: reading a value
back out of a generated artifact, or out of an external one, is the
same operation.

### Escaping is ON; `esc:` is an optional key

**Every `replace` value is escaped.** That is the default and it is not
opt-in — a generator that interpolates unescaped data is the bug this
whole section exists to close, so the safe behaviour is the one you get
by writing nothing.

It costs nothing: the escape is a **no-op on any value that was already
safe**, and a fix on the rest. VERIFIED for the worked generator — no
service name and no message carries a character `esc(_, sq)` would
change, so the twelve files are byte-identical either way.

**`esc:` is therefore an OPTIONAL key that names the variant**, not a
switch that turns escaping on:

```aon
{match: …, replace: {PIN: .pin}, body: [ … ]}            # escaped, C / JSON
{match: …, esc: sq, replace: {PIN: .pin}, body: [ … ]}   # escaped, single-quoted
{match: …, esc: none, replace: {…}, body: [ … ]}         # the explicit opt-out
```

The handlers carry `esc: sq` throughout because every literal in them
is single-quoted, which is exactly the case the C default does not
cover. `esc: none` is for a replacement that is not going into a
literal at all — an identifier or a whole statement — and it is the
only way to get an unescaped value, so it is visible in the template
rather than implied by its absence.

**No metadata on the value, and that is deliberate.** The obvious
alternative is to mark a string as already-escaped so `emit` can skip
the default when the author escaped it themselves — but a new value mark has parity, canon-hash and `fmt`
consequences in both ports, and marks leak:
[BUGS §79](../../use-cases/BUGS.md) is a live case of `join` folding a
`hide`-marked child into returned text. Declaring the variant on the
template gets the same result for one word, and **`esc` is then never
written inside a `replace` value at all**, so "was it already applied?"
is a question that never arises.

**Open:** a body needing two literal conventions in one template. Today
that means two templates. A per-key override would need a spelling that
does not collide with a genuine list value, and none of the obvious
ones read well; recorded rather than invented.

## D5. `rep` and `split`: deriving names

```
rep(src: string, re: string, sub: string) : string
```

A generator derives names as much as it interpolates them, and the
assessed backend proves it: its serverless YAML names an SQS queue
`QueueAimIngestProcessEpisode`, derived from the pin
`aim:ingest,process:episode`. Nothing in the language does that today.

**`re` is the same portable subset `re()` takes** — RE2-compatible, no
backreferences, no lookaround, per
[AONTUCONSTRAINTS.0.md](AONTUCONSTRAINTS.0.md). One regexp language in
the document, not two, and the subset's linear-time guarantee matters
more here than in a constraint: a generator runs this over model data.

**`sub` is a substitution string in the JavaScript spelling** — `$1`…
`$9` for numbered groups, `$&` for the whole match, and `$$` for a
literal `$`.

**Corrected during implementation: there is no `$<name>`.** This note
first listed one, for a group RE2 names with `(?P<name>…)`. The pattern
subset REFUSES `(?` other than `(?:` — the two engines spell a named
group differently (`(?P<n>` against `(?<n>`) and normalisation cannot
answer with one string both accept — so a named group is not a thing a
pattern here can have, and a substitution spelling for one names
nothing that can exist. `$1`…`$9` are the groups.

**Also corrected: `[:,]` is outside the subset**, and so is any class
opening `[:`, which is read as the start of a POSIX class. `re()`
refuses it identically, which is the point — one regexp language, one
refusal. The class is written `[,:]`.

**It replaces every match.** `re()` is unanchored and a
replace-the-first default is a footgun in a generator that normalises
separators; anchoring is how you ask for one.

Two refusals rather than silent results, by the same posture as `esc`'s
unknown variant: a pattern outside the subset refuses at the call, and
a `sub` naming a group the pattern does not have refuses rather than
expanding to nothing.

**`rep` does not close the motivating case on its own**, and it is
worth being exact about why:

| step | result |
| --- | --- |
| `rep(.pin, "[,:]", " ")` | `aim ingest process episode` |
| `upper(…)` | `AIM INGEST PROCESS EPISODE` |
| wanted | `QueueAimIngestProcessEpisode` |

A string substitution cannot change case, and `upper`/`lower` are
whole-string. What is missing is per-WORD capitalisation.

### `split`, and the chain that closes it

```
split(src: string, sep: string | re(…)) : [&: string]
```

A plain string separator is a LITERAL; an `re(…)` argument is a
pattern. That asymmetry with `rep` is deliberate — splitting is usually
on a literal, replacing is usually by pattern — and it removes the trap
where `split(v, ".")` silently splits on every character.

Three rules the chain below depends on: **an empty separator yields
characters**; a separator that does not occur yields the whole string
as one element; and empty fields are preserved, so `join` is its
inverse.

With `split`, the motivating case closes **using a phase already in the
plan and no case operator at all**:

```aon
title: join(form(split(w, ""), match(key(), "0", upper(_), _)), "")
name:  `Queue` + join(form(split(.pin, re(`[:,]`)), <title>), "")
```

VERIFIED by simulating the chain over the real pin: it produces
`QueueAimIngestProcessEpisode` exactly.

Two engine facts make it work, and one of them is why `form` is in the
plan at all:

- **`key()` resolves inside a list spread and yields the index** —
  VERIFIED, `[&: {k: key()}] & [{w:'aim'},{w:'ingest'}]` gives `k` of
  `"0"` and `"1"`. That is what lets a per-element transform know it is
  looking at the first character.
- **`pack` over a list of strings REORDERS** — VERIFIED,
  `pick(pack(['aim','ingest','process','episode'], …), u)` returns
  `AIM, EPISODE, INGEST, PROCESS`, sorted. So the map has to be
  `form`, the order-preserving map of
  [G9](../capability-review/g9-transformation.md) phase 3, which is
  exactly the gap that phase records.

**So `split` is the one new builtin the case needs**, and it earns its
place independently — splitting a path, a pin or a version string is
not a generator-only operation. A `title()`-style builtin is then
**sugar over a capability that exists** rather than a missing
primitive, which is a much better place for it: the chain above is
five calls and doubly nested to capitalise a word, so the sugar is
still worth having, but nothing is blocked without it.

### What landed

`esc`, `usc`, `rep` and `split` are in both ports as ordinary string
builtins, with 99 shared rows in `test/spec/str.tsv` and five codes —
`esc_variant`, `usc_malformed`, `rep_pattern`, `rep_sub`, `split_sep`.
Beyond the two corrections above, three things the note left implicit
are now decided:

- **Both ports spell every convention out by hand.** Neither host's
  library agrees with the other's: `JSON.stringify` escapes what Go's
  `encoding/json` does not, and `encodeURIComponent` leaves `!'()*`
  where RFC 3986 percent-encodes them. A generated file has to be
  byte-identical whichever engine wrote it.
- **`rep` and `split` carry their own matching loops**, in the
  semantics Go's `regexp` package defines. JavaScript INSERTS a
  pattern's capture groups into a split result where Go does not, reads
  `$1x` as group 1 then `x` where an Expand-style template reads the
  name `1x`, and disagrees about empty matches at the ends. The loops
  are written once and the TypeScript port reaches Go's answer.
- **`usc` refuses a lone surrogate.** `\uD83D` with no partner is not a
  character Go can carry, so answering one in TypeScript would be a
  divergence in the one direction this pair exists to remove. A valid
  pair combines; a lone one is `usc_malformed`.

The chain D5 closes with — `join(form(split(…), …), "")` — waited on
`form`, which was G9 phase 3 and landed with RENDER P6 (below). `split`
is the part of it that landed here, and it earns its place on its own:
splitting a path, a pin or a version string is not a generator-only
operation.

**2026-09-06, RENDER P6.** `replace` and `esc` on a template are in
both ports as D3 and D4 describe, with one code beside the two static
checks — `replace_value`, a value that is not text — and `form` landed
with them, so the chain D5 closes with, `join(form(split(…), …), "")`,
now runs (`test/spec/gen-form.tsv` `form-chain`). The twelve handlers
of D7 are [`use-cases/17-lambda-handlers/`](../../use-cases/17-lambda-handlers/):
the generator in the canonical form, over a model written for the
case, rendered byte-identically from both ports and held by `aontu
render --check`. What P8 adds is the surface itself — the `//-`
marker, the desugar and the resugar.


## D6. The canonical quote is chosen per line

Raw backticks need no escaping and read best, so a body line takes one
unless it holds a backtick, in which case it takes the escaping quote
with `\` and `"` escaped. VERIFIED: `` log(`handler ${name} ready`) ``
survives as `` "  log(`handler ${name} ready`)" ``, where the raw quote
could not represent it at all.

This is the one place the canonical form is allowed to be less pretty,
because representability beats readability in a form no one writes by
hand.

**The residual escape needs no new syntax.** A line that still cannot
be written verbatim — one starting with the marker — is written in a
marker line AS its canonical element, and the re-sugaring leaves it
there because it TESTS the round trip: it rebuilds the target line,
desugars the rebuild, and accepts it only if that reproduces the
canonical line. **The sugar is the fixpoint of the two transforms
rather than a table of escapes**, and an un-representable line is
simply one the fixpoint leaves alone.

## D7. Templates go where their output goes

`emit`'s table argument is an expression, so it can be a literal at the
call site — which means a template is written **exactly where its
output appears**, indented to match, with no new mechanism. (The
example below predates D2's 2026-09-07 amendment: `aontu fmt` now
writes the marker lines at the left margin with the aontu indented after
them. The output lines are where they were, which is what this decision
is about.)

```ts
//- @"./model.aon"
//- @"./wire.aon"
//- svc: $.main.srv & $.wire & pack($.main.srv, {name: key()})
//- files: emit($.svc, {match: {name: string}, esc: sq, replace: {SERVICE: .name}, body: [
import { getSeneca } from '../../env/lambda/lambda'

function complete(seneca: any) {
  //- emit(.listen, {match: {pin: string}, esc: sq, replace: {PIN: .pin}, body: [
  seneca.listen({type:'sqs',pin:'PIN'})
  //- ]}),
  //- emit(.client, {match: {pin: string}, esc: sq, replace: {PIN: .pin}, body: [
  seneca.client({type:'sqs',pin:'PIN'})
  //- ]}),
  //- emit(filter(.on.file.events, {source: 's3'}), {match: {source: 's3', msg: string}, esc: sq, replace: {MSG: .msg}, body: [

  const makeGatewayHandler = seneca.export('s3-store/makeGatewayHandler')
  seneca
    .act('sys:gateway,kind:lambda,add:hook,hook:handler', {
       handler: makeGatewayHandler('MSG') })
  //- ]}),
}

exports.handler = async (
  event:any,
  context:any
) => {
  
  let seneca = await getSeneca('SERVICE', complete)
  
  let handler = seneca.export('gateway-lambda/handler')
  let res = await handler(event, context)
  return res
}
//- ]})
```

That is the whole generator for twelve deployed Lambda handlers.
Indentation is right by construction: a body line is verbatim, so
`  seneca.listen(…)` is indented two spaces because that is where it
belongs in the generated file.

**Nothing in the mechanism is about handlers.** `emit`, `match`,
`replace`, `body`, `esc` and the marker are the whole vocabulary; what
makes this file produce Lambda handlers is the target text in it.

## D8. Whitespace control is absent, and one hazard is not

Every template engine grows trim markers — Jinja's `{%- -%}`, Go
templates' `{{- -}}`, ERB's `<%- -%>` — because a control construct
occupies a line and that line's newline leaks into the output. **This
surface has none and needs none: a marker line is not an output line at
all**, so a construct cannot leak anything. VERIFIED by the handlers,
which reproduce byte-identically including two blank lines and two
lines that are two spaces and nothing else.

The residual is one template used at two depths, and that is what the
fragment algebra's `at` is for — re-indentation on splice belongs to
the renderer, not to a template directive. Unverified: the shared-table
probe used one depth.

**The hazard is the template file's own trailing whitespace.** Those
two-space lines are significant, and an editor set to trim on save
destroys them silently. The canonical form quotes them explicitly, so
it is the artifact of record and a desugar-and-compare check catches
the damage — but the surface has to say so, because the first person
bitten will not guess.

## Verified

| property | result |
| --- | --- |
| Output against `voxgig/podmind` at `ab7f333` | **12 of 12 handler files byte-identical** |
| Round trip, both directions | identical |
| Concatenations in the canonical form | **0** |
| The generator file parsed as TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`) | **0 syntax errors** |
| `replace_overlap` / `replace_unused` | both fire on a seeded template |
| `esc(_, sq)` on this data | a no-op — the twelve files are identical either way |

The run is an expansion, because `emit`, `esc` and `usc` do not exist
yet; [EMIT.0.md](EMIT.0.md) records the four engine facts that make the
expansion necessary and the builtin unavoidable.

## Landed

**2026-09-06, as RENDER.0.md's P8.** `aontu template` is the verb —
desugar by default, `--resugar` the other direction, `--check` the
round trip, `--marker` for a language the table has not met — and
`render` reads a template entry directly, deciding by the ENTRY'S
EXTENSION as an include's extension decides what the include is. The
two transforms are `ts/src/template.ts` and `go/template.go`, held in
parity by `test/spec/template.tsv` (30 rows: the one rule, each
marker, the per-line quote, the residual escape, and the whitespace a
line is). `use-cases/17-lambda-handlers/handler.ts` is the acceptance:
the same generator as `gen.aon`, written as a Lambda handler, and it
renders the same thirteen units in both ports.

Three things shipped differently from this note:

- **A backtick string is not raw.** D6 assumed it needed no escaping;
  `` `C:\path` `` evaluates to `C:path`, so the backtick carries a
  newline but not a backslash. The per-line choice is unchanged — a
  backtick unless the line holds one, then the double quote — but a
  BACKSLASH is escaped under either, and the fixpoint refuses to sugar
  a canonical line whose escapes the quoting would not have written.
- **`fmt` does not reach into a template at all.** See below.
- **The whitespace hazard's guard is `render --check`, not
  `template --check`.** D8 says a desugar-and-compare check catches a
  trimmed body line, and that is true of a canonical form kept as an
  artifact of record. Nothing keeps one: `render` reads the template
  directly, so the canonical form is something to look at rather than
  something to commit. `template --check` therefore holds the file to
  the SPELLING the two transforms answer — a marker without its space,
  or aontu indented after the marker rather than before it — and a
  trimmed body line is still a valid template. What names that damage
  is `render --check` against the committed output, where the changed
  byte shows up as changed output. The surface still has to say so,
  which the reference and the how-to now do.

## Open

*All three were closed by what landed; each is kept with its answer,
because the answer is only legible beside the question.*

- **A body needing two escape conventions** — see D4. CLOSED by not
  arising: `esc` is per template, and a body needing a second
  convention is a second dispatch, which the surface already spells
  since a template is written where its output goes (D7).
- **The marker's own escape.** CLOSED as designed, and now documented:
  a target line beginning with the marker falls to the fixpoint rule
  and stays a marker line carrying its own canonical element. The
  reference says so in one line, which is what this note asked for.
- **`fmt` over a template file.** CLOSED, and the answer is that
  `fmt`'s reach is NIL rather than partial: it formats aontu source,
  `.aon` and `.aontu`, and refuses any other file by name. The reason
  is sharper than the question expected. A `#-` template PARSES as
  aontu, because `#` opens a comment — so `fmt` read one, discarded
  every body line as a comment, and rewrote the file with exit 0. A
  rule about which LINES `fmt` may touch could not have caught that; a
  rule about which FILES it opens does. `aontu template` is where a
  generator's own canonical form comes from.
