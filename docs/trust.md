# The aontu trust contract

*Status: normative. This document states the guarantees an agent
harness—or any host—may rely on when evaluating an aontu document,
and where each guarantee is conditional. It is the written half of the
contract; the tested half lives in the shared spec suite
([test/spec/](../test/spec/)), and anything stated here without a spec
pin says so plainly.*

For a document that agents evaluate unattended, safety guarantees are
not hardening applied afterwards—they are constitutive. The contract
is four clauses: **hermeticity**, **termination**, **determinism**, and
**sandboxing**.

## Clause 1: hermeticity

The output of an evaluation is a pure function of exactly four inputs:

1. the entry source text,
2. the resolved `@"…"` include closure,
3. the host-injected `$name` bindings, and
4. the evaluator: implementation (TypeScript or Go), version, and
   options.

Nothing else. The language has **no clock, no randomness, no
environment access, and no network**—the builtin functions are pure
value transformers, the `+` operator works over concrete scalars, and
external input enters only through includes and `$` bindings. No
construct that observes time or entropy will ever be added (see
[Refusals](#refusals) below); parameterise through `$` bindings
instead.

**Where this is conditional.** Input 2—the include closure—is only
a well-defined *input* when the resolver is confined, and confinement
is the **trust profile**, an option in **both** implementations:
`trust: { include: 'none' | {mem} | {root} | 'system' }` on
`AontuOptions` in TypeScript, `Aontu.Trust` (`TrustOptions`) in Go.
Under `none`, `{mem}` or `{root}` the closure is explicit and
hermeticity is TOTAL: `none` denies every `@"…"`, `{mem}` resolves
only the declared virtual file set, and `{root}` reads real files
realpath-confined below the root (a symlink inside the root pointing
outside it is an escape and is denied; package resolution never runs).
A few names are served under every capability but `none`, because they
are BUNDLED with the engine: `@"std/system"` and `@"std/view"`, the
[system and view vocabularies](reference-language.md#the-bundled-vocabularies),
and every `@"aontu:…"` name—the
[language-supplied models](reference-language.md#the-aontu-models),
`aontu:code`, `aontu:profile` and `aontu:lang/text`. An `aontu:` name resolves from the
engine's own table and nowhere else: the memory, module, file and
package legs are never asked, so nothing on disk can shadow one, and a
name the engine does not serve is refused naming the set rather than
searched for. None of them touches the filesystem or package
resolution, so they widen nothing a hermetic evaluation cares about—a
source that never leaves the process is as reproducible as a builtin
function—and each appears in the manifest under capability `std`, so
the closure still says it was read. Under `none` they are denied with
everything else: `none` means no includes at all.

A denied resolution is the located, deterministic parse-stage
`include_denied` error, pinned by `test/spec/include-trust.tsv` in
both runners. The resolved closure itself is observable as the
**include manifest**—sorted, deduplicated `{path, capability}`
entries on the parse result (`val.deps` in TypeScript,
`Aontu.IncludeDeps` in Go)—which is this clause's "file set" as
data.

Under the DEFAULT `'system'` capability the chain (memory →
filesystem → package in TypeScript; filesystem in Go) reads anything
the process can, the closure is machine-dependent, and the code's
posture is the operative warning:

> **Treat opening an untrusted source as reading your disk.**

Reading, never running. An include's extension decides what the file is:
thirteen extensions are read at all—`.aon` and `.aontu` as aontu
source; `.json`, `.jsonld`, `.jsonc`, `.json5`, `.jsonic`, `.jsc`,
`.toml`, `.yaml`, `.yml` and `.ini` as configuration data, each read by
its own parser; and `.txt` as text, which chooses no parser at all—and
everything else is refused by name, so no include is ever executed in
the evaluating process. `--text-ext` widens only the text set, and
cannot reach `.js`. The TypeScript package leg follows
the same rule: a package whose entry point is JavaScript does not
resolve.

`options.fs` still does not confine—it feeds source text for parsing
and error context, while the file and package legs read through their
own channels.

**The JSON-superset guarantee, stated precisely.** Every JSON document
*parses* as aontu. That is the whole claim. It does not say "behaves
identically to a JSON parser": the number tower refuses what JSON
silently corrupts, so `{"x":9007199254740993}`—a literal binary64
cannot carry exactly—is a loud `lossy_integer_literal` error in
aontu where `JSON.parse` would round it. Refusal-over-corruption is a
feature of the contract, not an exception to it.

## Clause 2: termination

Every evaluation halts within deterministic budgets counted in
**engine events, never wall-clock**:

| budget     | counts                                   | current state |
|------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `passes`   | fixpoint passes over the whole model     | 9 (`maxcc`, `ts/src/unify.ts`; `go/unify.go`) |
| `revisits` | same-pair re-unifications within a pass  | 999 (`MAXCYCLE`, `ts/src/unify.ts`) |
| `depth`    | structural recursion depth               | 1000 (`MAXDEPTH`, `ts/src/unify.ts`; `maxUniteDepth`, `go/unify.go`), plus Go's parse-depth guard (`max_depth`). Shared: both engines report `unify_cycle` past it, and `test/spec/budget.tsv` pins the boundary from both sides. |

(The shared 1000 sits above every real document and below both hosts'
stack limits, so the budget, not the host, decides the verdict.)

The contract pins *verdicts at default budgets*—every shared spec
row must produce the same verdict in both implementations—not
internal step counts, which remain implementation detail.

**Exhaustion is a semantic error, never silent truncation.** The
different answers—"your model is cyclic", "your model is
incomplete", "the budget ran out"—are distinct codes with distinct
classes (the registry: [test/spec/errcodes.tsv](../test/spec/errcodes.tsv);
the taxonomy rows: [test/spec/budget.tsv](../test/spec/budget.tsv)):

| code            | class       | meaning                                | valid agent response |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `path_cycle`    | `reference` | a **proven** structural cycle: a self/ancestor reference, or a chain of plain references revisiting a node (`a:$.b b:$.a`) | fix the model—no budget helps |
| `no_path`       | `reference` | a reference target that does not exist | supply what is missing |
| `budget_passes` | `budget`    | the pass budget was spent while the final pass was **still making progress**—the evaluator gave up mid-convergence | retry with a larger budget, or restructure |
| `unify_cycle`   | `budget`    | the revisit bound tripped: **suspected** non-convergence | inspect; may be a cycle or a very large model |
| `recursion_unexpanded` | `incomplete` | a required recursive-schema position that no data ever expanded—refused at generation, at the instance | supply the data, or guard the field (`next?:` drops, a `*null` preference generates) |
| `recursion_budget` | `budget` | a recursive schema expanded past the depth budget without meeting concrete data: two definitions feeding each other, or data deeper than the budget | restructure the definitions, or raise `trust.budget.depth` for genuinely deep data |

A *stable* residue—a stuck `1+true`, an unresolved kind—is none of
these: it is ordinary incompleteness, silent at unify time and a
generate-time error (`mapval_no_gen` family, class `incomplete`).
Only genuine cut-off earns `budget_passes`.

**Pattern matching is bounded by construction, not by a budget.** The
`re()` atom is the one place the evaluator runs a subsystem whose cost
no budget counts, and the two ports do not agree on complexity: Go uses
RE2, which is linear, while TypeScript uses JavaScript's backtracking
`RegExp`, which is not. A nested quantifier is enough to make the
difference unbounded—`(a+)+$` against twenty-nine characters takes 45
seconds in TypeScript and 0.065s in Go. The *semantic* half of that
mismatch is handled by normalising the pattern before either engine sees
it; complexity is the half normalisation cannot reach. Rather than add a
budget the host engine cannot be asked to respect, the [portable
subset](reference-language.md#re-and-the-portable-pattern-subset)
**refuses the shapes that cause it**: a quantifier may not be applied to
a group containing a quantifier or an alternation. That keeps this
clause true in the port that has the problem, at the cost of refusing
some patterns that would have been safe. Residual risk, stated plainly:
the rule is syntactic, so a pattern with a large but polynomial
backtracking cost is still admitted, and pattern matching remains
outside the event-counted budgets above.

Two notes on how the budgets behave, and one caveat:

- A chain of plain references resolves one link per pass from the tail
  in **both** engines, so the pass budget is part of the shared
  language surface: nine links fit, ten exhaust it as `budget_passes`,
  pinned by the shared `budget-chain-*` rows in
  [test/spec/budget.tsv](../test/spec/budget.tsv).
-  A cycle wearing a function call is the same cycle: `a:$.b
  b:upper($.a)` is `path_cycle` in both ports, which follow function
  arguments when detecting the cycle. The shape is pinned by the shared
  `path-cycle-func-routed`, `-msg` and `path-cycle-func-chain`
  rows—together with `path-cycle-func-no-cycle`, which pins that an
  ordinary function chain is still not a cycle.
- `unify_cycle` remains *suspicion*, not proof, which is why it is class
  `budget` and not `reference`: the revisit bound cannot distinguish a
  genuine cycle from a model too large to settle within it. A legal
  model with more than `MAXCYCLE` sibling conjunct terms at one path
  does not trip it; a 1200-sibling-term fixture driven through both
  engines pins that.

## Clause 3: determinism

Identical inputs (clause 1's four) produce **byte-identical canonical
output and byte-identical generated JSON**, across runs and across the
TypeScript and Go implementations. This is pinned, not promised:

- `canon` spec rows are strict string equality in both runners, and
  canon round-trips kind (a number-kind scalar always renders with a
  fraction or an exponent), so a canon row pins the value the engine
  *holds*, not only the JSON it emits.
- `gens` spec rows compare the serialised generate output **byte for
  byte** (compact, sorted keys, no HTML escaping, JS number
  formatting) using each port's real emitter.
- Error **codes** are stable and cross-implementation per the
  registry ([test/spec/errcodes.tsv](../test/spec/errcodes.tsv), `errc`
  rows); thrown-error message text is in cross-port parity (marker,
  headline, verbatim hints with injected details, and located
  ANSI source frames render identically, byte-guarded by the
  full-message twin tests), while spec rows continue to bind only
  their asserted substrings and codes.
- Expected values are **parity-probed**: obtained from both engines
  before a row is written, never copied from one (AGENTS.md).
-  Known disagreements live in exactly one place—the parity ledger—and
  its normal state is empty of open entries.

## Clause 4: sandboxing

What an evaluation may read is declared by the **host**, not by the
document: a `.aon` file cannot request more capability, includes take a
literal string (never a computed expression), and canonical form is
unaffected by any trust setting.

That declaration is the **trust profile** (clause 1), in both
implementations, at every surface:

- **Library**: `trust.include` on the evaluator options (TypeScript)
  / `Aontu.Trust` (Go). The default remains `'system'`.
- **LSP**: confined to the **workspace root** by default, from the
  `initialize` params (workspaceFolders, rootUri, rootPath, in that
  order). The capability governs the **whole** server—hover and
  hover-provenance as well as the diagnostics it publishes. An explicit
  `initializationOptions.aontu.trust.include` of
  `'system'`, `'none'`, `{root}` or `{mem}` widens or narrows it, and
  an unrecognised value confines to nothing rather than silently
  widening. A session with no workspace root and no explicit option
  stays unconfined, which single-file sessions rely on. A `file://`
  uri's path is everything after the literal `file://`, and the leading
  slash of a **drive-letter** path is uri syntax rather than path—so
  `file:///C:/Users/me/project` is the root `C:/Users/me/project`, not
  `/C:/Users/me/project`. Both ports read it that way. **A non-empty
  authority is not handled**: `file://server/share/x` yields
  `server/share/x`, a relative string, so a UNC root or a VS Code
  `wsl.localhost` remote root confines to nothing usable. Both ports
  behave the same way, and neither has a spelling for the UNC form
  (`\\server\share`).
- **CLI**: `--trust <system|none|root[:dir]>` and
  `--include-root <dir>`, accepted by the bare command **and by every
  verb**, and by the REPL, whose `--jsonl` session honours the
  capability for `:load`, `:get`, `:why` and bare snippets alike. A
  verb takes the flags anywhere in its argument tail; a bare `root`
  means the primary document's own directory, matching the bare
  command's entry root. The default is `'system'` **with a warning**:
  every resolution that escapes the entry file's directory, or goes
  through package resolution, prints a one-line stderr warning naming
  the flags. The warning is a deprecation notice: a later major
  version denies those resolutions by default, and `--trust system`
  keeps the unconfined chain.

Denied resolution is a located, deterministic parse-stage error
(`include_denied`) like any other—never a silent skip—and is
raised, not injected as a value, so a bare-member include
(`@"denied.aon"` at the top of a file) cannot vanish in the merge.

Budgets are part of the same profile: `trust.budget.passes` and
`trust.budget.depth` (TypeScript) / `TrustOptions.Budget` (Go), integer
counts of engine events defaulting to the spec constants of clause 2.
The per-pair revisit bound is NOT profile surface—the Go dispatcher
has no revisit counter to configure, and a knob one port cannot honour
would break the parity contract by construction.

## Evaluation consumes the tree

A parsed `Val` tree is **single-use**: `unify`/`generate` refine it in
place, and reusing a consumed tree (or any node reachable from it) in
a second evaluation is a *correctness* bug that surfaces as
nondeterminism—the exact failure mode this contract exists to
exclude. Parse again (or clone first) for every independent
evaluation. This is a rule of the API contract (see
[the API reference](reference-api.md#evaluation-consumes-the-tree)).

## Refusals

Guarantees are as much about what will never be added:

- **No wall-clock or memory budgets**—a limit that varies with
  machine load makes identical inputs fail differently.
- **No `now()`, `random()`, or `env()`**—each would falsify
  clause 1 by construction.
- **No Turing-completeness, no SMT solvers**—termination stays
  structural plus fuel; every trust question is answered by counting,
  never by solving.
- **No executable hooks in evaluation**—no callbacks or shell-outs;
  the resolver is the language's only effect, which is why confining
  the resolver confines the language.
