# G7: A machine-facing access surface

*Status: design proposal — phases 1–6 (`get` and its projections,
`why` with its provenance recorder, the overlay `set`, and the
delivery skin: MCP server, `diff`, published grammar, skill,
`agentsmd`) are implemented; phase 7 (the REPL inspection mode) is
not, and neither is phase 5's stage 2, the format-preserving in-place
edit. Per-phase status and the
corrections this document needs are in the
[progress register](progress.md), which is authoritative for status;
this document is authoritative for design. Part of the
[capability review](index.md) (August 2026). This document expands gap
G7 — query, provenance, patch, and delivery: the surfaces through
which agents consume an Aontu definition as ground truth — with
alternatives, an explicit boundary, risks, and an implementation
plan.*

## Problem

Agents do not consume ground truth by evaluating whole files into one
JSON blob. They hold lightweight identifiers, retrieve task-sized
slices on demand, ask why a value holds, and patch by path. Aontu
today supports none of these: the CLI (ts/src/cli.ts) evaluates one
file to JSON or canonical form, full stop, and the evaluated output
is a terminal artifact rather than a knowledge substrate.

First failure: query. A modest system definition —

```aon
# system.aon
services: &: {
  image:    string
  replicas: integer
  owner:    string
}
services: auth:    { image: "auth:v2.3", replicas: 3, owner: "identity" }
services: billing: { image: "billing:v1.9", replicas: 2, owner: "payments" }
services: gateway: { image: "gw:v4.0", replicas: 4, owner: "platform" }
```

An agent repairing the auth deployment needs `$.services.auth` and
nothing else. It wants to write `aontu get $.services.auth --canon`
— and cannot. The only option is `aontu system.aon`, whose output
grows linearly with the whole system: every billing and gateway
token is context-window noise for the auth task. The survey's
context-engineering doctrine is unambiguous — the smallest set of
high-signal tokens, retrieved just-in-time by identifier — and there
is no way to follow it. Nor is there a cheaper first look: no
keys-only listing ("what services exist?"), no types-only view
("what shape must a service have?"), no depth limit.

Second failure: provenance. Layered definitions are Aontu's home
ground:

```aon
# org.aon
services: &: { replicas: *1 | integer }

# service.aon
@"org.aon"
services: auth: { replicas: 3 }
```

The evaluated result has `replicas: 3`. A reviewer — human or
agent — asks: why 3? Which file set the default, which overrode
it? The question has no answer today. Sites (`{row, col, url}`)
are tracked only for *errors*: a conflict gets a two-site
`NilVal`, but on every successful unification the winning value
keeps its own site and the peer's is dropped — `update()` in
ts/src/unify.ts is literally a one-line function with a
`TODO: update x with y.site` comment. So
`aontu why $.services.auth.replicas` cannot be built without
touching the engine, and LSP hover (ts/src/lsp.ts `computeHover`)
can show the resolved value but never its origin story. CUE's
community documents exactly this as the incumbent's worst pain;
building positive provenance into a young engine is far cheaper
than retrofitting it later.

Third failure: patch. The agent decides auth needs five replicas.
The lattice-honest move — append a new conjunct — fails correctly
but unhelpfully:

```aon
@"service.aon"
services: auth: { replicas: 5 }   # conflict: 5 vs 3 — correct, but
                                  # now what?
```

`3` is a pinned literal, so the overlay conflicts; the right repair
is to edit the pinning site. But there is no evaluated-path →
file/line map to find that site, canon destroys comments and source
order by construction (docs/reference-language.md), and no
format-preserving rewriter exists — the parser stack discards
comments at parse time. The agent's remaining option is regex
surgery on text it does not understand.

Finally, delivery. There is no MCP server, so none of the above is
reachable from an agent harness; the REPL is human-only (no
structured per-command protocol); and no machine-consumable grammar is
published, so constrained decoding — now production infrastructure
— cannot guarantee syntactically valid Aontu emission. Aontu is a
low-resource language for every model, and the llms.txt post-mortem
shows a file sitting in a repo is advisory unless tools actively
pull it into agent loops.

## Current state

What exists and is reusable:

- **Path lookup.** `ctx.find(path: string[])` (ts/src/ctx.ts) walks
  the unified root through `MapVal`/`ListVal` pegs — the seed of
  `get`. TS only: go/ctx.go has no equivalent; it is also not
  exposed on any CLI.
- **Per-node canonical form.** `Val.canon` renders any node, not
  just the root, as deterministic reparseable text
  (docs/reference-language.md). A path-scoped slice is therefore
  "find, then canon" — the rendering half of query is free.
- **The explain trace.** `AontuOptions.explain`
  (docs/reference-api.md) threads an opt-in trace through
  `ctx.explain`; `explainOpen`/`ec`/`explainClose` and
  `formatExplain` (ts/src/utility.ts) record every `unite` call in
  ts/src/unify.ts as nested positional arrays (pass count, path,
  operand ids and canon, result). Honest assessment: this is a
  *derivation trace*, not provenance. It proves the hook points
  exist and costs nothing when off (`ctx.explain &&` guards), but
  it records no file/line sites, has no per-path index, grows with
  every unite call across up to `maxcc = 9` passes, its positional
  format is not a contract, and it is TS-only — the Go port has no
  explain machinery at all.
- **Sites, lazily.** `Site` (ts/src/site.ts) carries
  `{row, col, url}`; `Val` allocates its site on first access via a
  getter (ts/src/val/Val.ts) — an explicit optimisation because
  most sites are never read. Provenance must not silently defeat it.
- **The LSP split.** The library/handler/server layering
  (ts/src/lsp.ts, ts/src/lsp-server.ts, go/lsp, docs/lsp.md) is the
  template for any resident surface: pure analysis functions, a
  transport-free protocol handler, a thin stdio loop. Hover already
  reads the unified tree — and re-parses and re-unifies the whole
  document per request, which bounds what per-request provenance
  may cost.
- **A REPL.** ts/src/cli.ts ships one (CUE has none): line-oriented,
  one `Aontu` instance per session, each line evaluated
  independently, `:canon`/`:json` mode switches. A head start for
  an inspection tool.
- **Marks as projection machinery.** `hide`/`type` marks already
  exclude nodes from generation (ts/src/val/BagVal.ts) — evidence
  the engine can carry view-relevant metadata through unification.

What structurally blocks the capability:

- **Positive provenance is not recorded.** Success drops the peer's
  site (`update()` in ts/src/unify.ts); only `NilVal` keeps
  `primary`/`secondary`. Nothing remembers which ordered conjuncts
  produced a resolved value.
- **Single-use trees.** The documented contract in ts/src/val/Val.ts
  (the MapVal/ListVal TOP fast-path refines in place) makes parsed
  and unified trees single-use. A resident server cannot cache live
  `Val`s and serve queries from them; it must cache *rendered*
  artifacts.
- **Unification is global.** A `$.path` reference or spread anywhere
  can contribute to any node, so there is no sound partial
  evaluation of a fragment. `get` must evaluate the whole document;
  the honest win is output slicing plus caching, not partial
  evaluation.
- **No source map, no CST.** Comments and layout are discarded at
  parse; no evaluated-path → contributing-spans map exists; nothing
  can rewrite a file in place while preserving what the author
  wrote.
- **No grammar artifact.** The surface is defined operationally by
  the jsonic plugin stack (ts/src/lang.ts and the `@tabnas/*`
  ports); there is no declarative grammar file to publish.
- **Resolver posture.** Any resident server inherits the
  memory → filesystem → package resolver chain (`makeModelResolver`,
  ts/src/lang.ts) and its documented stance that opening
  an untrusted source is running it — confinement is
  [G5](g5-trust-contract.md)'s contract and a precondition here.

## Prior art

**Context engineering and progressive disclosure.** Anthropic's
doctrine (smallest high-signal token set, identifiers over
documents), the Skills three-tier loading model (~100-token stub,
body on demand), and Context7's resolve-then-query pattern all
converge: agents prefer querying an authority for a scoped fragment
over holding a corpus. Cost: someone must run the authority.

**GraphQL introspection.** The proven model of "schema queryable
by the consumer" — the critique pass notes the survey's query
recommendations partially reinvent it. Its lesson is the habit it
created, not its machinery; the machinery costs a full query
language with resolvers, far beyond path selection.

**SysML v2 API & Services and Structurizr's MCP server.** MBSE
learned that a language without a standard machine API cannot
anchor a toolchain; Structurizr — the nearest commercial neighbour
— already ships an MCP server so agents can inspect architecture
models. Neither has constraint checking worth the name; Aontu's
differentiator is that its slices are *unified, validated* values.
Cost of the SysML route: an enormous REST/CRUD spec surface.

**nix why-depends and OPA's explain ladder.** The exemplars for
"why": a shortest path through the graph with the exact fragment at
each hop; filtered trace levels (full for machines, notes for
humans, fails as default). CUE's discussion #3723 (30+ stacked
sites, 3,000-line config, debugging by deletion) is the
counter-example that motivates doing this early; CUE is on its
second evaluator partly to retrofit error tracking.

**Terraform plan.** Diff-as-explanation works — until noise
destroys trust. Deterministic canon already gives Aontu
noise-free diffs; the design must protect that, not add it.

**Grammar-constrained decoding.** Lark CFGs are accepted by
provider custom-tool APIs; llguidance/XGrammar make enforcement
cheap; GBNF covers local inference. A published grammar makes
syntactic validity guaranteed and leaves semantics to the unifier —
a clean two-layer story competitors lack. Few-shot studies say
low-resource DSLs are learnable given a grammar card plus curated
examples. Cost: the artifact must be parity-tested against both
parsers forever, or it rots into a liar.

**AGENTS.md versus llms.txt.** The delivery-channel verdict:
harnesses actively read AGENTS.md (adopted across agent tooling);
llms.txt failed because nothing pulled it. Ship the stanza and the
tools that make it true, not a passive file.

## Design space

**A. Library-only.** Document `ctx.find` and `explain`, let the
ecosystem build servers. Near-zero cost; but Go has neither
surface, the explain format is not a contract, and the llms.txt
lesson says capabilities nothing pulls into loops go unused.
Rejected.

**B. CLI slicing only.** Ship `get` with projections and a REPL
JSON mode; defer provenance, patch, and MCP. Cheap and real; but
"why" is the incumbent's most documented pain and gets strictly
more expensive to add as the engine matures, and without MCP the
surface never reaches the harnesses that need it. Kept as Phase 1
of the plan, not the end state.

**C. A query language.** Embed filters and predicates
(JSONPath-style wildcards, jq-like expressions) in CLI and MCP.
Powerful, but it is a second language to specify, teach, and keep in
TS/Go parity — surface-area creep of exactly the kind
[index.md](index.md) warns about, and the survey's agent-usage
evidence is that path + fixed projections cover the consumption
pattern. Rejected.

**D. Always-on provenance.** Extend the engine so every `Val`
carries its ordered conjunct history with sites, unconditionally.
Best possible UX (hover-provenance with no second evaluation); but
it taxes every evaluation for a rarely-asked question, collides
with the lazy-site optimisation the hot path relies on, and grows
memory with conjuncts × passes. Rejected for v1 — but its *data
shape* should be designed now so always-on can land later behind a
flag when incremental evaluation makes it cheap.

**E. Staged surface on today's engine.** Path-scoped `get` with
lattice-sound projections; provenance-on-demand (`why`
re-evaluates with an opt-in recorder — the explain pattern with
sites and a per-path index); patch as overlay-append first,
format-preserving rewriting later; delivery via a thin MCP server
over the TS library, a published grammar, a skill, and an
AGENTS.md generator; the REPL grown into an inspection tool. Costs
honesty: `get` is not faster than full evaluation, `why` runs the
evaluator twice, stage-1 patch cannot change pinned values in
place.

**Recommendation: E, with D's record shape specified up front.**
It is the only option honest about the engine (global unification,
single-use trees, lazy sites) that still ships every consumption
surface the survey identifies. It matches the review's sequencing
note that G7 depends on nothing and is the cheapest adoption wedge
— it wraps today's evaluator, and every later capability
([G2](g2-validation-verb.md) vet,
[G3](g3-subsumption-evolution.md) breaking) becomes another tool
on the same server.

## Proposed design

### Query: `aontu get`

```
aontu get <path> [file] [options]

  -c, --canon      canonical-form fragment (default: JSON)
  --keys           keys at the node, one level
  --types          shape view: concrete leaves generalised to kinds
  --depth <n>      subtree to depth n; elided nodes render as top
```

Semantics: evaluate the whole document (stated plainly: unification
is global, so there is no partial evaluation to sell), select the
node with the `ctx.find` walk promoted to parse `$.a.b` path syntax
(escaped keys, numeric list indices), and render:

- default: generated JSON of the fragment — which inherits `gen`
  semantics, including the known `DisjunctVal.gen` fold defect
  (ts/src/val/DisjunctVal.ts, ~line 263) until it is fixed;
- `--canon`: the fragment's canonical form — constraint-preserving,
  deterministic, and for the root path byte-identical to today's
  `--canon` output (pinned by a spec row).

A missing path is an error reported via the
[G2](g2-validation-verb.md) contract (a `no_path`-family code with a
nearest-key suggestion); `get` invents no error format.

### Projections are lattice abstractions

The three projections are defined so that each emits a *valid Aontu
document that subsumes the truth* — generalisation, never
distortion:

- `--types` replaces each concrete scalar with its kind:
  `{"image":"auth:v2.3","replicas":3}` becomes
  `{"image":string,"replicas":integer}`. When
  [G1](g1-constraint-algebra.md)'s bounds land, this view renders
  them via G1's canonical bound syntax — consumed here, defined
  there.
- `--depth n` keeps structure to depth n and renders every elided
  subtree as `top` — "no further information at this tier".
- `--keys` is `--depth 1 --types` degenerated to a listing.

This gives progressive disclosure the Skills model wants — a
stub-sized first tier, expansion by path on demand — with a property
no markdown spec has: every tier is itself checkable, and "view
subsumes truth" is mechanically verifiable once
[G3](g3-subsumption-evolution.md)'s `subsume` exists. Projections
are not canonical form and are never fed to
[G6](g6-distribution.md)'s hash; the flags are distinct from
`--canon` to keep that unambiguous.

Caching: single-use trees mean a resident server must never hold
live `Val`s. The unit of caching is the *rendered* slice, keyed by
(content hash per [G6](g6-distribution.md), path, projection) —
which also makes slices prompt-cache-stable, the economics G6
identifies.

### Provenance: `aontu why`

```
$ aontu why $.services.auth.replicas service.aon
$.services.auth.replicas = 3
  1. *1 | integer   org.aon:2:26    (spread &: at org.aon:2:11)
  2. 3              service.aon:3:29
resolved: 3 — literal overrides preference *1
```

Mechanism: `why` re-runs the evaluator with a provenance recorder
on the context — the explain pattern, but recording a *contract*,
not a debug trace. The recorder is keyed by `ctx._pathidx` (the
path trie in ts/src/ctx.ts already assigns stable per-path
indices) and captures an ordered entry at each point where
information currently vanishes: the `update()` site-drop in
ts/src/unify.ts, the `ConjunctVal` fold, spread application in
`MapVal`/`ListVal`, `PrefVal` resolution (chosen versus
overridden), and `RefVal` resolution (ref site plus target path).
Entries are deduplicated by (pathidx, contributing val id) — ids
are unique per run (ts/src/val/Val.ts) — so fixpoint revisits
across up to `maxcc = 9` passes do not multiply the record.

The record shape (the part designed now for a later always-on
mode):

```json
{ "path": "$.services.auth.replicas", "value": "3",
  "conjuncts": [
    { "canon": "*1|integer", "role": "spread",
      "site": { "file": "org.aon", "row": 2, "col": 26 } },
    { "canon": "3", "role": "literal",
      "site": { "file": "service.aon", "row": 3, "col": 29 } } ] }
```

`--format json` emits it; sites reuse the G2 site object shape.
Costs, honestly: `why` is two evaluations (determinism, per
[G5](g5-trust-contract.md), guarantees the second derives the same
result); memory is proportional to conjunct events on the queried
run; the lazy-site getter is untouched on the normal path, and
instrumented runs pay site materialisation knowingly. LSP
hover-provenance reuses the recorder: hover already re-unifies the
whole document per request (ts/src/lsp.ts), so recording during
that existing re-evaluation is a config-gated increment, not a new
cost class. `why` is the positive twin of G2's error report:
errors explain what failed to unify; `why` explains what did.

### Patch: `aontu set`, in stages

**Stage 1 — overlay append (no rewriter needed).**

```
aontu set $.services.auth.owner=\"identity-2\" \
  --entry system.aon --overlay changes.aon
```

Appends a path-flattened conjunct
(`services: auth: owner: "identity-2"`) to the overlay file
(creating it if absent), then re-evaluates entry + overlay and
reports a [G2](g2-validation-verb.md)-shaped verdict. This is
semantically clean: an overlay entry is just another conjunct, and
unification is order-independent — no parsing of the target file,
no comment or layout damage, nothing to preserve. It refines open
values and fills unpinned fields. What it *cannot* do is change a
pinned value: the lattice correctly rejects `5` against `3`, and
the verdict says so with the pinning site — which `why` locates.
The loop "set → conflict → why → edit the pinning site" is
coherent even before stage 2, with the last step manual.

**Stage 2 — format-preserving in-place edit (deferred, L).**
Requires two missing assets: an evaluated-path →
contributing-source-spans map (a by-product of the provenance
recorder) and a comment-and-layout-preserving CST for the parser
stack, which today discards comments. Only then can
`aontu set --in-place` rewrite the pinning literal where the
author wrote it. Sibling documents deferring "applying a fix" to
G7's format-preserving patch surface ([G2](g2-validation-verb.md),
[G3](g3-subsumption-evolution.md)) are deferring to this stage;
until it lands, overlay-append is the only patch verb, and the
docs must say so.

### Delivery: the MCP server

A thin server over the TypeScript library, following the LSP's
three-layer template (docs/lsp.md): a transport-free tool library
(ts/src/mcp.ts), a stdio server (ts/src/mcp-server.ts), published
as a bin (`aontu-mcp`). Tools, all returning the same JSON
contracts as the CLI:

| Tool    | Backed by                                            |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `vet`   | [G2](g2-validation-verb.md)'s verb and report        |
| `get`   | the query surface above (path + projection)          |
| `why`   | the provenance recorder                              |
| `diff`  | path-addressed diff of two evaluations' canon        |
| `canon` | normalise a source text to canonical form            |

`diff` is dyff-style — deterministic canon on both sides means no
phantom noise — and reports *what changed at which paths*; whether
a change is breaking is [G3](g3-subsumption-evolution.md)'s
question, exposed later as G3's tool on this same server.
Resources implement progressive disclosure: a document summary
(root keys + G6 hash) with resource links to path-scoped slices.
The server runs with a confined resolver (memory/filesystem
allowlist) per [G5](g5-trust-contract.md); the package resolver
leg is never enabled under a server. The Go port ships no separate
MCP server: its role is gateway/sidecar embedding of the same
library calls (`get`/`why` land in the Go API for parity), and
any Go MCP wrapper is left to hosts.

### Grammar, skill, AGENTS.md stanza

- **Published grammar**: `grammar/aontu.lark` and
  `grammar/aontu.gbnf`, covering the documented emission surface
  (excluding `@"…"` includes — constrained decoding should not
  emit source-loading directives). Parity-tested from day one:
  every canonical-form output in the shared spec suite must parse
  under the published grammar, and grammar-sampled strings must be
  accepted by both real parsers. Conservative by construction: it
  may under-approximate the surface, never over-approximate it.
- **Official skill**: a ~100-token trigger stub, a one-page grammar
  card, curated examples (JSON-superset first: agents may write
  plain JSON and add operators incrementally), and the G2
  error-code index for repair loops.
- **`aontu agentsmd`**: generates or updates an AGENTS.md stanza
  from the definition itself — where the truth lives, how to
  `vet`, `get`, and `why` it — so the prose entrypoint cannot
  drift from the formal source.

### REPL as inspection tool

The existing REPL (ts/src/cli.ts) gains `:load <file>` (evaluate
once and hold the *rendered* document — canon text plus JSON,
respecting single-use trees), `:get`, `:keys`, `:why`, and a
`--json` session mode in which every command answers in one JSON
line, making the REPL drivable by a harness. Human-readable output
stays the default.

## Boundary: what we will not do

- **No query language.** Path plus fixed projections only; filters
  and predicates are a second language and surface-area creep
  toward CUE, a trap named in [index.md](index.md).
- **No partial-evaluation claims.** `get` evaluates the whole
  document; incremental evaluation is a later engine project shared
  with the LSP, and marketing slicing as speed would be false.
- **No always-on provenance in v1.** On-demand only; the record
  shape is the forward-compatible part, the collection policy is
  not.
- **No format-preserving rewriting in stage 1.** Overlay-append
  ships first precisely because it needs no rewriter; in-place
  editing waits for the CST and the source map.
- **No error-format invention.** Every failure across get/why/set
  and the MCP tools is reported via the
  [G2](g2-validation-verb.md) contract.
- **No fetching or arbitrary writes in the server.** The MCP server
  evaluates what it is given under a confined resolver
  ([G5](g5-trust-contract.md)); distribution and pinning are
  [G6](g6-distribution.md)'s; the only write tool is the overlay
  append.
- **No subsumption semantics in `diff`.** Path-level change
  reporting only; breaking-ness is
  [G3](g3-subsumption-evolution.md)'s verb.
- **No LLM components in the surface.** Deterministic, mechanical
  answers are the entire pitch against the JSON-Schema-plus-prose
  null hypothesis; an LLM summariser tool would surrender it.
- **No view/diagram generation in v1.** Model-once-render-many is
  real (Structurizr) but is an exporter product; the projection
  ladder is G7's contribution to it.

## Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Provenance instrumentation slows the uninstrumented hot path | Medium | High | Explain-style `ctx` guards (already proven zero-cost when off); benchmark gate in CI before/after Phase 3; lazy-site getter untouched on the normal path |
| TS/Go divergence: Go has no `find`, no explain, no collect surface | High | High | `get`/`why` land as shared spec rows (query.tsv, provenance.tsv) run by both suites with no skip list; Go port is a dedicated phase, not an afterthought |
| Resident server misuses single-use trees (stale or corrupted Vals) | Medium | High | Server caches rendered artifacts only, keyed by G6 content hash; a test asserts no `Val` outlives its evaluation |
| Why-chains explode on large conjunct fan-in (CUE's 30-site pile-up) | Medium | Medium | Dedupe by (pathidx, val id); default chain cap with `--all`; order entries by application, not discovery |
| Published grammar drifts from the real parsers | Medium | High | CI parity test: all spec-suite canon outputs parse under the grammar; sampled grammar strings accepted by both parsers; grammar versioned with the language |
| Projections mistaken for canonical form (fed to hashes/pins) | Medium | Medium | Distinct flags; projected output carries no `--canon`; G6 hashes only unify-level canon; docs state it |
| `get --json` hits the DisjunctVal.gen fold defect | Medium | Medium | Default agent guidance is `--canon`; fix tracked with regression spec rows; JSON output of unresolved disjunctions documented as affected until then |
| Overlay files accumulate into an unreadable sediment | High | Low | One well-known overlay per entry document; `why` shows overlay sites like any other; consolidation tooling deferred to stage 2 |
| MCP spec churn breaks the server | Medium | Low | Tool library is transport-free (LSP split); only ts/src/mcp-server.ts tracks protocol versions |
| Adoption risk: agents read the file instead of calling tools | Medium | High | `aontu agentsmd` writes the stanza that names the tools; skill teaches the get/why/vet loop; slices are cheaper in tokens than the file — measured and stated |
| Canon round-trip regression via fragment rendering | Low | High | Spec row pins `get $ --canon` == document canon; canon convergence stays green in every phase |

## Implementation plan

Spec-first throughout: every behaviour lands as `test/spec/*.tsv`
rows before code; TypeScript (canonical) first, Go follows. Nothing
may regress in any phase: every row of the shared suite (counts in [the register's protocol rule 5](progress.md#the-update-protocol)),
canon convergence, LSP diagnostic parity, and
the performance of uninstrumented evaluation.

**Phase 1 — `get` and projections, TypeScript (M).**
Spec: new `test/spec/query.tsv` — columns name, source, path,
projection, output — including the pins `get $ --canon` ==
document canon and projection-subsumes-truth examples. Code: new
ts/src/query.ts (path parsing, projection rendering over the
`ctx.find` walk); ts/src/ctx.ts (escaped keys, list indices);
ts/src/cli.ts (`get` verb); docs/reference-api.md. Runner:
ts/test/spec.test.ts learns the query mode.

**Phase 2 — `get`, Go port (M).**
Code: new go/query.go; go/ctx.go (find); go/cmd/aontu.
go/spec_test.go runs query.tsv with no skip list.

**Phase 3 — provenance recorder and `why`, TypeScript (L).**
Spec: new `test/spec/provenance.tsv` — name, sources (multi-file
via the memory resolver so file/line assertions are stable), path,
ordered chain (`canon@file:row:col` entries with roles). Code: new
ts/src/provenance.ts (recorder, record shape, JSON rendering);
ts/src/unify.ts (the `update()` site-drop and unite hooks);
ts/src/val/ConjunctVal.ts, ts/src/val/PrefVal.ts,
ts/src/val/MapVal.ts, ts/src/val/ListVal.ts, ts/src/val/RefVal.ts
(record points); ts/src/cli.ts (`why`). Benchmark gate on the
uninstrumented path.

**Phase 4 — `why`, Go port (L).**
Code: go/provenance.go (new); go/unify.go, go/conjunct.go,
go/pref.go, go/mapval.go, go/listval.go, go/ref.go; go/cmd/aontu.
Byte-identical `--format json` output pinned by provenance.tsv.

**Phase 5 — overlay `set` (M).**
Spec: new `test/spec/patch.tsv` — source, set expression, overlay
result, verdict — pinning that overlay-append is semantically
identical to hand-written conjuncts (order-independence rows).
Code: new ts/src/patch.ts; ts/src/cli.ts; Go twin go/patch.go
(S once TS settles). Verdicts via the G2 report.

**Phase 6 — delivery: MCP server, grammar, skill, agentsmd (M).**
Code: new ts/src/mcp.ts (transport-free tool library) and
ts/src/mcp-server.ts (stdio), mirroring the LSP split; `agentsmd`
verb in ts/src/cli.ts; new grammar/aontu.lark and
grammar/aontu.gbnf with parity tests (ts/test/grammar.test.ts, a
Go acceptance twin driven by the same sampled corpus); skill
sources under docs/. The server ships with the memory/filesystem
resolver only.

**Phase 7 — REPL inspection mode and hover-provenance (S).**
Code: ts/src/cli.ts (`:load`, `:get`, `:why`, `--json` JSONL
mode); ts/src/lsp.ts and go/lsp (config-gated provenance in hover
markdown). LSP diagnostic text is unchanged.

## Open questions

- **Path syntax details.** Escaping for keys containing dots, and
  list indices (`$.a.0` versus `$.a[0]`); align with reference
  syntax and [G4](g4-identity-relations.md)'s identity paths before
  query.tsv freezes the spelling.
- **Provenance granularity.** Leaf scalars only, or container-level
  events too (one entry for a spread over `$.services` versus one
  per child)? Container events are cheaper and often what a
  reviewer wants; leaf events are what patch stage 2 needs. The
  recorder likely wants both behind a filter; spec rows decide the
  default.
- **One evaluation or two in the server.** A resident server could
  evaluate with the recorder always on, making `why` free at query
  time at the cost of memory per document version. Measure on
  realistic models; the CLI keeps the two-run model regardless.
- **Fragment canon as a stable contract.** Is the canon of a slice
  stable across engine versions (making slice and prompt caches
  durable), or only within a version? Interacts with
  [G6](g6-distribution.md)'s hash scheme id; needs an explicit
  statement either way.
- **Grammar scope versus teaching scope.** Should the emission
  grammar also exclude rarely-emitted forms (custom marks, `@`
  directives) to shrink the constrained-decoding surface, with the
  skill teaching the full language? Small grammars are cheaper to
  learn; the risk is agents acquiring a dialect.
- **Overlay conventions.** One well-known overlay per entry
  document versus per-agent overlays; declared in the entry file
  (`@"changes.aon"`) or composed by the tool at evaluation time.
  Composition-by-tool keeps the source honest but hides a conjunct
  from plain `aontu system.aon`; interacts with
  [G6](g6-distribution.md) module boundaries.
