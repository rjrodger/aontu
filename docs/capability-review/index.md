# Capability review: Aontu as a systems ground truth for agents

*Status: review (August 2026). This document records a survey of the
literature, comparable languages, and industry practice, asking one
question: what fundamental capabilities does Aontu lack to fulfil its
stated purpose — a systems-definition language and ground truth for
agents? Each identified gap has a companion design document (G1–G8,
linked below) with alternatives, boundaries, risks, and an
implementation plan.*

Method: a ten-agent survey — three codebase analysts over this
repository, six researchers (CUE; Nickel/Dhall/Pkl/KCL/Jsonnet/Starlark;
refinement types and formal methods; ontologies and MBSE; agent-industry
practice; developer tooling and visualisation), plus an adversarial
fact-checking pass over the combined findings.

## The verdict in brief

Aontu's kernel is the right bet, and the survey validates it from
several independent directions. The lattice guarantee — any observed
field value holds for the final result; merging is commutative,
idempotent, and fails loudly on conflict — is exactly the property that
makes a definition trustworthy in a way markdown can never be. The
closed-world validation stance is the one the semantic-web community
needed two separate languages (OWL, then SHACL) to reach; Aontu has it
as a per-node dial. The JSON-superset surface means agent-emitted JSON
is already valid Aontu. And the dual TypeScript/Go implementation with a
shared machine-readable spec suite is an unusual asset: the same
semantics embeddable in Node agent harnesses and Go gateways.

But today, "type safety through unification" cashes out as **five
scalar kinds, literal equality, disjunction-enums, and closedness** —
`a: number > 0` is a parse error (verified live), there is no regex,
and no length or cardinality constraint. Cross-field *equality* is
expressible through references (`b: $.a` conflicts if `b` is pinned
elsewhere), but no cross-field inequality or general predicate is.
And the language is an *evaluator of its own files*, not yet a
*service other things are checked against*: `@"file"` can load and
unify external data and the TS API exposes `ctx.find(path)`, but
there is no dedicated validation verb with a structured report
contract, no CLI query surface or token-efficient projections, no way
to ask why a value holds, and no check that v2 of a schema still
honours v1.

The industry context sharpens the stakes. The 2024–26
spec-driven-development movement (GitHub Spec Kit, AWS Kiro, OpenAI's
Model Spec, AGENTS.md, Agent Skills) chose structured *markdown* — and
its acknowledged weakness is that prose specs cannot detect
contradiction, drift, or type error; OpenAI had to build an entire
LLM-graded eval harness just to measure compliance with its own spec.
The enforcement camp (OPA/Rego, Cedar, Kubernetes CEL) proves that
deterministic, non-Turing-complete, analysable languages are what
actually gets deployed at decision boundaries — AWS chose Cedar for
agent authorisation explicitly for determinism and analysability.
**Nobody has fused the two: a language that is simultaneously the spec
agents read and the gate that validates their output.** That is the
position Aontu targets, and the survey's clearest conclusion is that
the fusion is won or lost on the capabilities below — mostly
infrastructure around the lattice, not syntax on top of it.

## The eight fundamental gaps

| # | Gap | Why it changes what the language is | Design doc |
|---|-----|-------------------------------------|------------|
| G1 | A real constraint algebra | Makes "type safety through unification" true beyond five kinds; everything else is downstream | [g1-constraint-algebra.md](g1-constraint-algebra.md) |
| G2 | The validation verb | Turns Aontu from expression evaluator into agent guardrail (emit → validate → repair) | [g2-validation-verb.md](g2-validation-verb.md) |
| G3 | Subsumption as a query; schema evolution | Ground truth is a claim about time; the lattice makes compatibility checking nearly free | [g3-subsumption-evolution.md](g3-subsumption-evolution.md) |
| G4 | Identity and typed relations | Systems are graphs; Aontu documents are trees with document-scoped paths | [g4-identity-relations.md](g4-identity-relations.md) |
| G5 | A specified trust contract | Hermeticity, termination, determinism, sandboxing — constitutive for unattended agent evaluation | [g5-trust-contract.md](g5-trust-contract.md) |
| G6 | A distribution layer | Versioned, integrity-hashed, pinnable modules; truth must be shareable and tamper-evident | [g6-distribution.md](g6-distribution.md) |
| G7 | A machine-facing access surface | Query, provenance, patch, MCP — agents consume slices, not whole evaluated blobs | [g7-machine-access.md](g7-machine-access.md) |
| G8 | Generation, on the total side of the fork | N children from data without copies that drift — and without losing the termination guarantee | [g8-generation.md](g8-generation.md) |

## What Aontu already has right

These are assets the review recommends protecting — several have no
equivalent in CUE:

- **The lattice kernel** — schema, defaults, and data as one kind of
  value; order-independent merge engineered deliberately (conjunct-term
  sorting, canonical closed-map unify direction) and pinned by the
  shared spec.
- **Closed-world validation with a per-node dial** — `close()`/`open()`,
  including closed *lists*, which CUE's structs don't cover.
- **JSON-superset surface** — any JSON document is valid Aontu, so
  agent output can be unified directly against a definition with no
  conversion. This is the substrate for a `vet` operation (G2) and
  dramatically lowers the LLM learning cliff for a low-resource
  language.
- **Canonical form** — a deterministic, reparseable normal form. The
  research upgrades this from a convenience to an economic asset: it is
  the seed of semantic hashing (G6), semantic diff, and
  prompt-cache-stable serialisation.
- **Dual TS + Go implementations with the TSV spec contract** — 45 spec
  files, ~426 rows, run identically by both. The suite is itself a
  machine-readable ground truth an LLM can be taught from, and the
  parity method (spec rows first, both implementations follow) is
  exactly how every capability below should land.
- **Ranked preferences** — defaults of defaults (`**` outranks `*`),
  richer than CUE's single level and a natural fit for layered system
  definitions (org < team < service).
- **Spreads** (`&:`) that work on lists, cross-statement, and via
  referenced templates — beyond CUE's pattern constraints in several
  directions.
- **Native variant modelling** — disjunction is a variation point,
  preference is the default variant. SysML v2 had to bolt on
  `variation`/`variant` keywords for what Aontu's core already
  expresses compositionally.
- **In-memory resolver and host-injected `$name` variables** — good
  bones for sandboxed, parameterised agent evaluation.

## The gaps, in summary

Each summary below is expanded — with alternatives considered, an
explicit boundary of things we will not do, a risk assessment, and an
implementation plan — in its companion document.

### G1 — A real constraint algebra

The single highest-leverage gap, and the one the language's central
claim rests on. What is needed is not just `number > 0` but a
*vocabulary of constraint atoms that are lattice citizens*: numeric
bounds, regex patterns, string/list/map length and cardinality
("between 2 and 5 replicas", "exactly one primary"), scalar negation,
and cross-field inequalities via existing path references. The
liquid-types lesson: no SMT solver is needed — a closed vocabulary of
predicate constructors, each with meet, emptiness, and subsumption
rules written down. Interval intersection decides `>5 & <3 → nil` at
schema-composition time — something evaluate-only systems (CEL, KCL,
Nickel contracts) can never do. For arbitrary domain rules beyond the
algebra, the escape hatch is an evaluate-only predicate with an
author-attached failure message, honestly reported as evaluate-only.
A related defect: both implementations pin numbers to IEEE-754 double
semantics, so int64-scale values silently lose precision; CUE
deliberately uses arbitrary-precision decimals.

### G2 — The validation verb

The canonical agent loop — *emit, validate, repair* — currently has no
entry point: the CLI evaluates one file to JSON, full stop. Because
Aontu is a JSON superset, `aontu vet schema.aon candidate.json` is
nearly free to implement (unify + closedness + report), and it changes
the language's identity from evaluator to gate. The same verb, pointed
at a live system dump, is drift detection. The output contract matters
as much as the verb: stable error codes, JSON and SARIF output,
severities, author-attached messages, and errors that state **what
would have unified** — repair-loop studies find admissible
alternatives, not failure location, drive an agent's ability to
self-correct.

### G3 — Subsumption as a first-class query; schema evolution

Ground truth is a claim about *time*: agents act on stale snapshots,
and the truth evolves. Aontu's lattice makes the principled version of
compatibility checking nearly free: new schema subsumes old ⇒ backward
compatible; the reverse ⇒ forward compatible; both ⇒ full. Exposing
subsumption — as a builtin, a CLI verb
(`aontu breaking --against git#main system.aon`), and a library call —
powers versioned evolution, default-validity checking, CUE-style trim,
and the entailment queries agents actually need. Paired with a
deprecation mark surfaced at point of use, it gives shared schemas a
complete evolution story. The fact-check pass ranked this Aontu's most
defensible differentiator.

### G4 — Cross-document identity and first-class typed relations

Systems are graphs; Aontu documents are trees with document-scoped
paths. Today the language cannot say "this `dependsOn` target must
exist and be a Service", cannot declare or check an inverse relation,
cannot forbid a cyclic dependency path, and cannot merge two files
that describe the same real-world entity unless they share a tree
path. The adoptable shape, without abandoning the JSON tree: a stable
identity mark on any node, a reference constraint with referential
integrity checked at unification time, and path constraints. Notably,
unification gives cross-document identity cleaner semantics than the
semantic web ever had: declaring two nodes the same entity means
unifying them, so a contradiction is a hard, located error rather than
the silent corruption of `owl:sameAs`. Ports/interfaces/connections —
the recurring MBSE primitives — need no new syntax: ship them as a
blessed standard-library schema vocabulary.

### G5 — A specified trust contract

For an artifact that agents evaluate unattended, safety guarantees are
not hardening — they are constitutive. Today the gap is real: the
default resolver makes opening an untrusted file equivalent to running
it (`@"pkg"` can `require()` arbitrary modules; the LSP inherits
this), and the fixpoint's hard 9-pass bound means models that need a
tenth pass silently stop refining rather than erroring distinctly.
Hermeticity — same file set + same `$` bindings ⇒ identical output —
is currently *false* under the default resolver: a package include
can execute a module whose export derives from time, environment, or
filesystem state, so identical sources can produce different results.
It holds only under confined resolvers (memory/filesystem), and
resolver confinement is therefore part of *establishing* the
guarantee, not merely documenting it. The work:
write the guarantees down, pin them in the spec suite (including
byte-identical canonical output across TS and Go), give the evaluator
API a capability surface, adopt import-sandbox rules before `@"…"`
ever goes remote, and make evaluation bounds semantic errors rather
than silent truncation.

### G6 — A distribution layer

Textual file inclusion is a single-project mechanism. Ground truth
must be shareable across repos, teams, and agent sessions, and
tamper-evident when it travels. The ecosystem default is settled —
versioned modules with lockfiles, distributed over OCI registries.
The differentiator on top: Dhall-style **semantic integrity hashes
computed over Aontu's canonical form**. A pin hashes the *meaning*,
not the bytes — refactors and comments don't break it; any semantic
change anywhere in the transitive closure does. One honest caveat the
design must resolve: canon today is deterministic *syntax*, not a
unique semantic normal form (`number|integer` denotes the same value
set as `number` — `DisjunctVal` drops only `same()` alternatives —
yet the two canon differently), so hashing requires either a
subsumption-based minimisation step before the hash or the weaker,
clearly-labelled claim of a canonical-text hash. Aontu's existing
canon still makes either variant nearly free, and no
unification-family language has it.

### G7 — A machine-facing access surface

Agents do not consume ground truth by evaluating whole files into one
JSON blob — they retrieve task-sized slices and patch by path. Three
surfaces are missing: **query** (`aontu get $.services.auth --canon`
returning the evaluated fragment, plus token-efficient projections),
**positive provenance** (`aontu why $.path` — today sites are tracked
only for errors; extending site-tracking to successful unifications is
far easier to build now than to retrofit later, as CUE's history
shows), and **semantic patch** (set a path through unification with
re-validation — which also requires a comment-preserving,
format-preserving rewrite story that canon alone cannot provide).
Delivery matters as much as capability: an official MCP server
(validate/query/why/diff/canon), an AGENTS.md stanza, an official
skill, and a published machine-consumable grammar for constrained
decoding.

### G8 — Generation and abstraction, resolved on the total side

Producing N similar children from data — one block per service, per
region, per replica — is the bread-and-butter of systems definition.
Without it, humans and agents copy-paste, and the copies drift, which
defeats ground-truth-ness from inside. Aontu's spread applies a schema
to children that exist; nothing can *generate* children, compute a
key, or interpolate a string. This is also the language's deepest
identity question: every credible safety story surveyed (Dhall,
Starlark, CEL, Cedar) lands on the same side — a ground truth
evaluated unattended by agents must terminate by construction. Take
comprehension power from total combinators
(`each`/`pack`/`filter`/`match`) and bounded evaluation budgets, and
treat "Aontu evaluation always terminates, deterministically" as a
headline, spec-guaranteed feature.

## Traps to refuse

The survey found as much evidence about what *not* to build. Each of
these is a documented failure mode in an adjacent system:

- **Turing-completeness.** Recursive user functions trade away the
  termination guarantee that makes unattended agent evaluation safe.
- **SMT solvers in the checker.** Documented proof flakiness and
  solver-version nondeterminism (F*) are disqualifying for a
  dual-implementation language whose product is deterministic answers.
- **Temporal/behavioural logic in the language.** "Replicas eventually
  converge" is inexpressible in a value lattice by construction.
  Represent state machines as ordinary Aontu data and export to
  TLA+/P — be the structural front end, not the model checker.
- **General negation/complement.** Sound only atop semantic-subtyping
  machinery that costs months across two implementations. Scalar-level
  negation (`!=`, not-in-set) composes fine within the bounds algebra.
- **Surface-area creep toward CUE.** Every stratum CUE added raised
  its floor; its highest-profile adopter (Dagger) dropped it as users'
  number-one complaint. Aontu's small, JSON-superset surface is a
  moat — especially for LLMs, where grammar size is acquisition cost.
  Also heed CUE's deepest scar before deepening types: pin down the
  interactions of `*`, closedness, and spreads in the spec suite
  first; those are the non-lattice-pure features that forced CUE's
  multi-year evaluator rewrite.
- **Ignoring the null hypothesis.** The strongest competitor for
  "ground truth for agents" is JSON Schema 2020-12 plus prose. Aontu's
  answer must be stated explicitly and delivered mechanically:
  merge-as-unification, subsumption-as-compatibility, located two-site
  conflicts, semantic hashing — the things JSON Schema structurally
  cannot do.

## Sequencing

| Phase | Capabilities | Rationale |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| A — make the claim true | G1 constraint algebra core (bounds, regex, length/count) · G2 `vet` with structured reports, stable codes, admissible-alternative errors · G5 trust contract written and spec-pinned | These convert "type safety through unification" from positioning into fact, and open the emit → validate → repair loop |
| B — differentiate | G3 `subsume`/`breaking` · G6 canon-hash pinning · G7 `get`/`why` + MCP server + published grammar + skill | Each is nearly free given the lattice and canon, and no competitor has the principled version |
| C — scale | G4 identity/relations + stdlib vocabulary · G6 full module registry · G8 total generation combinators · incremental LSP · views/diagram exporters · JSON Schema interop | Ecosystem weight; several depend on Phase A |

The exception: the G7 query/MCP surface depends on nothing and is the
cheapest adoption wedge — it could ship first, wrapping today's
evaluator, and every later capability becomes another tool on the same
server. Throughout, the existing method is the right one: every
capability lands as TSV spec rows first, both implementations follow,
and property-based differential testing guards the algebra as the Val
zoo grows.

Progress against this table is tracked phase by phase in the
[progress register](progress.md). In short: Phase A is most of the way
done — the trust contract, the error-code registry, the whole constraint
algebra (bounds, `re`, `length`/`unique`, cross-field residuation and
`must`), and the `vet` verb in both ports, with shared rows for all of
it. Outstanding in A: SARIF/watch (G2.5) and multi-error collection
(G2.6). Phases B and C are untouched.

## Verified codebase facts referenced by the design documents

Checked against this repository at review time (TS v0.49.0 line).
**Four of these have since moved — the review's own work changed them
— and are marked inline; the rest still hold as written.**

- ~~Exactly 12 builtin functions~~ **now 17**, hard-wired in the
  parser's `funcMap` (`ts/src/lang.ts`): `upper`, `lower`, `copy`,
  `key`, `type`, `hide`, `move`, `path`, `pref`, `close`, `open`,
  `super`, plus G1 phase 1's Band A atoms `min`, `max`, `above`,
  `below`, `neq`. (`ExpectVal` is internal spread-required machinery,
  not a user-callable function.)
- Scalar constraints are kind-only; `a: number > 0` fails to parse
  (verified by running the CLI). **Still true as written — there is no
  operator sugar — but bounds themselves now exist in function form
  (`a: number & min(0)`), so the underlying gap is partly closed.**
- ~~45 shared spec files (~426 rows; modes `canon`/`gen`/`err`)~~
  **the suite has grown by roughly 4.5× and gained three modes**; the
  Go runner executes every row with no skip list. Counts move with
  every capability phase, so they are kept in one place with their
  reproduction commands — see the
  [progress register](progress.md#the-update-protocol), rule 5. Several
  gap documents froze a count into a "nothing may regress" clause and
  are now stale by 1,400-odd rows.
- The fixpoint is bounded at `maxcc = 9` passes (`ts/src/unify.ts`);
  `MAXCYCLE = 999`.
- The resolver security posture is documented in code
  (`ts/src/lang.ts`, "treat opening an untrusted source as running
  it").
- Disjunct generation has a known distribution defect, acknowledged in
  a code comment (`ts/src/val/DisjunctVal.ts`).
- ~~Both implementations use IEEE-754 double number semantics (Go
  reproduces JS `Number.toString`).~~ **Superseded by G1 phase 6,
  which went well past the "decide and bound the defect" it was
  scoped as: numbers are now a four-leaf tower
  (`integer < float < biginteger < bigdecimal`), exact leaves opt-in
  via a `0d` prefix, and a literal that is integer-kind but not
  exactly representable is a located `lossy_integer_literal` error
  rather than a silently rounded value. See
  `docs/design/number-tower.md`.**
- Parsed/unified trees are single-use (documented mutation caveat);
  the LSP re-parses and re-unifies whole documents per change.
