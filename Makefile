# INSTALL FROM THE CLONE, EACH BUILD BY ITS OWN TOOLCHAIN.
#
#   make install       # both
#   make install-ts    # npm link: the global `aontu` IS this checkout
#   make install-go    # go install: a build of ./cmd/aontu and ./cmd/aontu-lsp
#
# The two builds ship the same commands under the same names, and each
# toolchain puts them where it always does -- npm's global bin
# (`npm prefix -g`/bin, so this needs the write access `npm install -g`
# needs) and Go's (`go env GOBIN`, else GOPATH/bin). With both installed,
# PATH order decides which `aontu` answers and `aontu --version` says
# which did: the npm series or the Go series. The TypeScript install is
# a LINK, so `make build-ts` updates it in place; the Go install is a
# build, so rerun `make install-go` after a change. Undo with
# `npm uninstall -g aontu` and by deleting the two Go binaries.

# ONE COMMAND, BOTH ARTIFACTS -- WITH THEIR OWN VERSION SERIES.
#
#   make publish V=0.53.0 GOV=0.2.0   # release both
#   make publish V=0.53.0             # npm only
#   make publish GOV=0.2.0            # Go module only
#
# npm and the Go module are versioned independently, deliberately: sharing a
# major would put the Go module at v2+, and Go requires the major in the
# module path from v2 on (see check-go-major), which changes every consumer's
# import path. Two numbers is the cheaper trade.
#
# Bumps whichever versions are given, runs the full suite, commits, pushes
# main, and dispatches the publish workflow with matching inputs.
#
# Every guard runs BEFORE anything is written, because half of this cannot be
# taken back: npm never allows republishing a version, and proxy.golang.org
# caches a Go module version immutably.
#
# See docs/release-and-tag.md.
