This unifier is heavily inspired by [Cue Lang](https://cuelang.org/)
and may be regarded as a purpose-specific dialect.


## Implementations

Aontu ships two implementations, kept in parity (structure inspired by
[`voxgig/util`](https://github.com/voxgig/util)):

- **TypeScript** in [`ts/`](ts/) — the canonical implementation
  (published to npm as `aontu`).
- **Go** in [`go/`](go/) — a port (`github.com/rjrodger/aontu/go`) that
  mirrors the core unification semantics.

Both are checked against a single, language-agnostic test suite in
[`test/spec/`](test/spec/) (tab-separated cases run by both
implementations). See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and
[docs/shared-spec.md](docs/shared-spec.md).

```sh
make build   # build both (ts + go)
make test    # test both against the shared spec
```

### Repository layout

```
ts/          canonical TypeScript implementation (src, test, dist, dist-test)
go/          Go port (package aontu)
test/spec/   shared *.tsv unit tests both implementations must satisfy
docs/        documentation
```

## Command line

Both implementations ship an `aontu` command that evaluates a file (or
stdin) and prints the result, or starts a REPL when run with no file:

```sh
aontu config.aontu            # evaluate a file -> JSON
aontu --canon config.aontu    # canonical form instead
echo 'a:1 b:$.a' | aontu      # read from stdin
aontu                         # no file on a terminal -> REPL
```

Install with `npm i -g aontu` (Node) or
`go install github.com/rjrodger/aontu/go/cmd/aontu@latest` (Go). From a
clone: `node ts/dist/cli.js …` or, inside `go/`, `go run ./cmd/aontu …`.
