# aontu: JSON structure unifier

aontu combines data, schemas, and defaults into one consistent result,
or reports where they conflict. It is a purpose-specific dialect
inspired by [CUE](https://cuelang.org/).


## Implementations

aontu ships two implementations, kept in parity (structure inspired by
[`voxgig/util`](https://github.com/voxgig/util)):

- **TypeScript** in [`ts/`](ts/): the canonical implementation
  (published to npm as `aontu`).
- **Go** in [`go/`](go/): a port (`github.com/aontu-lang/aontu/go`) that
  mirrors the core unification semantics.

Both are checked against a single, language-agnostic test suite in
[`test/spec/`](test/spec/) (tab-separated cases run by both
implementations). See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and
[docs/shared-spec.md](docs/shared-spec.md).

```sh
make build     # build both (ts + go)
make test      # test both against the shared spec
make install   # put both builds on PATH from this clone (npm link, go install)
```

### Repository layout

```
ts/          canonical TypeScript implementation (src, test, dist, dist-test)
go/          Go port (package aontu)
test/spec/   shared *.tsv unit tests both implementations must satisfy
docs/        documentation
```

## Command line

Both implementations ship an `aontu` command that evaluates a file (or
stdin) and prints the result, or starts a REPL when run with no file:

```sh
aontu config.aontu            # evaluate a file -> JSON
aontu --canon config.aontu    # canonical form instead
echo 'a:1 b:$.a' | aontu      # read from stdin
aontu                         # no file on a terminal -> REPL
```

Beyond evaluation the command has a verb for each task around a
document: `vet` (validate data against a schema), `get` and `why`
(query, and provenance), `set` (change a value in an overlay, by
appending or in place), `subsume` and `breaking` (schema evolution),
`hash` (pin what a document means), `relations`, `reaches` and `view`
(the declared entity graph: its checks, reachability over it, and its
figures drawn as text: tree, matrix, graph, layers, sets, the meet
ladder, the subsumption poset, the key document and the value
lattice), `jsonschema` (export
the model as JSON Schema), `render` (fold an `aontu:code` instance
into files, or check the files it wrote), `template` (read a generator
written in the target's own syntax), `trim` (find redundant
entries), `mod`
(dependency closures), `agentsmd` (an AGENTS.md stanza), `fmt` (the
source formatter, in the tradition of `gofmt`: one agreed form), `lsp`
(the language server) and `mcp` (the MCP server, npm build). The
library adds a path-addressed `diff`, and an MCP server answers with
the same reports over stdio. All of it is documented in
[docs/reference-api.md](docs/reference-api.md).

Install with `npm i -g aontu` (Node); with
`curl -fsSL https://aontu.dev/install.sh | sh` on Linux or macOS, which
puts the Go build of `aontu` and `aontu-lsp` in `~/.local/bin` with no
toolchain; with a package or archive from the
[releases page](https://github.com/aontu-lang/aontu/releases), the
image `ghcr.io/aontu-lang/aontu`, the Nix flake, or the setup action
`aontu-lang/aontu/setup-action` in a workflow; or with
`go install github.com/aontu-lang/aontu/go/cmd/aontu@latest` (Go). From a
clone, `make install` puts both builds on `PATH`: `make install-ts` links
the checkout as the global npm package and `make install-go` runs
`go install` for the two commands. Without installing:
`node ts/bin/aontu.js …` or, inside `go/`, `go run ./cmd/aontu …`.
